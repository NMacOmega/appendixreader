                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>1.</strong> A prominent city of Israel, more frequently mentioned in the Bible than any other except Jerusalem. It is identified with the ruins by the modern village of Beitin, about 17 km (11 mi) N of Jerusalem. It thus lay on a rocky ridge in the extreme southern part of the mountainous region of Ephraim at about 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level. The surrounding area today is quite barren, consisting of a stony plateau with sparse vegetation. Yet the existence of several springs there shows that the ancient city had an excellent water supply.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Bethel’s position was strategic and contributed greatly to its importance. Situated on the backbone of the central mountain range, it was on the important N-S route that followed the watershed line, running all the way from Shechem southward through Bethel, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron, and down to Beer-sheba. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 21:19</a>.) Another route connected Bethel with Joppa to the W on the Mediterranean and with Jericho to the E near the Jordan. Bethel was thus a crossroads town, as were Samaria, Jerusalem, Hebron, and Beer-sheba. Additionally, the evidence indicates that the area between Jerusalem and Bethel was a region of dense population, having a greater concentration of towns than any other part of Palestine.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Archaeological excavations at Beitin reveal it to be a site of great antiquity, the suggestion being given that the original settlement dated back to about the 21st century B.C.E. Evidence was also found of a severe destruction and conflagration leaving debris and ashes 1.5 m (c. 5 ft) deep in some places, and this is believed likely to have occurred during the conquest of Canaan by Israel.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Upon Abraham’s entry into Canaan, he stopped at Shechem and then moved S “to the mountainous region to the east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 12:8</a>) After spending some time in Egypt because of a famine in Canaan, Abraham again settled to the E of Bethel, in company with his nephew Lot. Since in both cases Abraham pitched tent to the E of Bethel, it is suggested that the site of his encampment was at Burj Beitin, a short distance SE of Beitin, which has been called “one of the great view-points of Palestine.” (<em>Encyclopædia Biblica,</em> edited by T. K. Cheyne, London, 1899, Vol. I, col. 552) It may have been from such a vantage point that Abraham invited Lot to select the direction in which he would go upon separating from Abraham, with the result that Lot “raised his eyes and saw the whole District of the Jordan” and decided in favor of that region. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 13:8-11</a>) Jehovah thereafter invited Abraham to view the land in all directions, assuring him that it would be for an inheritance to him and his seed.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 13:14, 15</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Although Moses, in compiling the Genesis account, speaks of the town near which Abraham camped as “Bethel,” the subsequent record shows its original Canaanite name to have been “Luz.” (See <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LUZ</a> No. 1.) Jacob spent the night near the city when traveling from Beer-sheba to Haran, and after having a dream of a ladder reaching to the heavens and hearing God’s confirmation of the Abrahamic promise, he thereafter set up a pillar and called the name of the place Bethel, although “Luz was the city’s name formerly.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 28:10-19</a>) Some 20 years later God spoke to Jacob at Haran, identifying himself as the one who had addressed Jacob at Bethel, and instructed him to return to Canaan.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 31:13</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Following the defilement of Dinah at Shechem and the act of vengeance executed by Jacob’s sons against the Shechemites, Jacob received God’s instruction to return to Bethel. After eliminating false religious articles from his household and servants, he traveled to Bethel under divine protection, built an altar there, and restated the name he had given the place earlier, calling it El-bethel, meaning “The God of Bethel.” Here Rebekah’s nursing woman Deborah died and was buried. Here, too, Jehovah confirmed the change of Jacob’s name to Israel, restating the Abrahamic promise.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 35:1-16</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Centuries later, upon the entry of the nation of Israel into Canaan (1473 B.C.E.), the name Bethel is again used to refer to the city previously called <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>Luz rather than to the camping site of Abraham and Jacob. In the account of the attack upon Ai, the record indicates that the Canaanite men of Bethel endeavored to support the men of that neighboring city, but to no avail. If not at that point, then at a later time Bethel’s king met defeat by Joshua’s forces. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 7:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/7/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 8:9,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/7/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/7/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 17;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/7/4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12:9,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/7/5\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 16</a>) Bethel thereafter appears as a boundary city between the territories of the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin. It is listed as assigned to Benjamin, but the record shows that it was the house of Joseph (of which Ephraim was a part) that effected the conquest of the city. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 16:1, 2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/8/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 18:13,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/8/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 21, 22;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/8/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Jg 1:22-26</a>) From this point forward the name Luz is no longer applied to the city.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">Bethel was on the circuit visited by Samuel as he judged the people annually at that city as well as at Gilgal and Mizpah, and it was still viewed as a place favored for worship. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/11/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Sa 7:16;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/11/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 10:3</a>) However, from then till the division of the kingdom (997 B.C.E.), Bethel is mentioned only in connection with King Saul’s stationing of troops in preparation for combat with the Philistines.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Sa 13:2</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">As a major city of the northern kingdom under Jeroboam, Bethel, once prominent as a place of revelation by the true God, now became renowned as a center of false worship. At Bethel, in the extreme S of the newly formed kingdom of Israel, and at Dan, in the extreme N thereof, Jeroboam set up the golden calves in his effort to dissuade the people of his realm from going to the temple at Jerusalem. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 12:27-29</a>) With its own religious house and altar, a specially invented festival time, and priests selected from among the non-Levitical tribes, Bethel became a symbol of rank apostasy from true worship. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 12:31-33</a>) Jehovah God did not delay in expressing his disapproval through a “man of the true God” sent to Bethel to pronounce judgment against the altar used in connection with calf worship. The ripping apart of this altar served as a portent, confirming the sure fulfillment of the prophet’s words. After leaving Bethel, however, this “man of the true God” allowed himself to be induced by an old prophet of Bethel to accept and act on a supposed message from an angel in violation of the direct orders from God, with disastrous consequences to himself. Slain by a lion, he was buried at Bethel in the personal burial place of the old prophet who saw in all these events the certainty of the fulfillment of Jehovah’s word and thus requested that his own body be buried at death in the same burial site.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/15/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 13:1-32</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">King Abijah of Judah temporarily wrested Bethel and other towns from the control of the northern kingdom (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ch 13:19, 20</a>), but it appears that Bethel had been restored to the northern kingdom at least by the time of King Baasha of Israel, since he endeavored to fortify Ramah, considerably to the S of Bethel. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 15:17;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/17/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2Ch 16:1</a>) Even though King Jehu later eradicated Baal worship from Israel, the golden calves continued undisturbed at Dan and Bethel.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/18/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ki 10:28, 29</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Despite the prevalence of false worship there, the record shows Bethel as the location of a group of prophets in the time of Elijah and Elisha. Bethel was also the home of the group of jeering boys who mocked Elisha, this costing many of them their lives as a result of divine execution.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ki 2:1-3,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/19/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 23, 24</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The prophets Amos and Hosea, in the late ninth and mid-eighth centuries B.C.E., proclaimed God’s condemnation of the religious corruption centered at Bethel. Although Hosea makes direct mention of Bethel (meaning “House of God”) only when recalling God’s revelation of himself to faithful Jacob there (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ho 12:4</a>), he evidently employs the name “Beth-aven,” meaning “House of Hurtfulness (Something Hurtful),” as applying to that city and the effect of its false religious practices.

The prophet Amos spoke in similar vein, showing that, no matter how frequent the sacrifices offered by the people at Bethel’s altars, their pious pilgrimages to that place only constituted the commission of transgression, and warning that Jehovah’s burning anger would blaze against them inextinguishably. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/24/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Am 3:14;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/24/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 4:4;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/24/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 5:5, 6</a>) Angered at this prophesying done by Amos right in Bethel, the apostate priest Amaziah accused Amos of seditious talk and ordered him to ‘go back to Judah where he came from’ and there do his prophesying: “But at Bethel you must no longer do any further prophesying, for it is the sanctuary of a king and it is the house of a kingdom.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/25/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Am 7:10-13</a>.</p>",

During or following Josiah’s 18th year of rule (642 B.C.E.), he extended his purge of false religion up into Bethel and also to the cities of Samaria. Josiah destroyed the site of idolatrous worship in Bethel, first burning the bones from nearby tombs on the altar, thereby desecrating it in fulfillment of the prophecy given by “the man of the true God” over three centuries earlier.

                "<p class=\"sb\">When the Israelites began to call to Jehovah for aid, God raised up “a savior” in the person of Ehud. In time, the Israelites sent tribute to Eglon by means of Ehud, who had made a two-edged sword for himself, “its length being a cubit [Heb., <em>goʹmedh</em>],” actually a linear measurement about which there is uncertainty in this particular case. Some believe it was a short cubit of about 38 cm (15 in.). Ehud was a left-handed man, or, literally, “a man closed (impeded) of his right hand.” But this does not mean that Ehud was crippled, as such Hebrew phraseology is used in connection with 700 Benjamite warriors, who are not likely to have had a physical defect but were “left-handed” and evidently ambidextrous. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001268/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 3:15, 16</a>, ftn; <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001268/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">20:16</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001268/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ch 12:2</a>.) The Bible does not specifically say Ehud was ambidextrous, though that is possible. Nevertheless, being left-handed, he girded the sword underneath his garment upon his right thigh.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">After presentation of the tribute, Ehud sent the tribute bearers away but turned back at the quarries of Gilgal. Ehud then came to Eglon as the Moabite king sat in his roof chamber, and he said to him: “A word of God I have for you.” Interested, Eglon arose from his throne. At that, Ehud “thrust in his left hand and took the sword off his right thigh,” plunging it into obese Eglon’s belly, with the result that “the handle kept going in also after the blade so that the fat closed in over the blade.” A right-handed man would likely draw his sword from his left side, across his body. So it is not probable that Eglon would expect Ehud to draw a sword from the right thigh, using his left hand. The enemy ruler now dead, Ehud escaped through the air hole, after closing and locking the doors of the roof chamber behind him. When Eglon’s servants finally opened the doors, they discovered that “their lord was fallen to the earth dead!”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001268/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 3:15-25</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Ehud, having escaped to the mountainous region of Ephraim, marshaled an army of Israelites, saying to them: “Follow me, because Jehovah has given your enemies, the Moabites, into your hand.” After capturing the fords of the Jordan, the Israelites cut off the Moabites’ retreat to their homeland. Doubtless already greatly demoralized by their king’s death, 10,000 Moabites were struck down by the Israelites, “every one robust and every one a valiant man; and not a single one escaped.” Moab having been subdued under Israel’s hand and Ehud’s leadership, “the land had no further disturbance for eighty years.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001268/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 3:26-30</a>.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">One of Israel’s outstanding judges; son of Manoah, a Danite from Zorah. Prior to Samson’s birth an angel appeared to his mother and announced that she would bear a son who was to be a Nazirite from birth and “take the lead in saving Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 13:1-5,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/0/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 24;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/0/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 16:17</a>) As future leader in the fight against the Philistines, Samson would have to come near the dead bodies of persons slain in battle. Therefore, the very nature of his commission showed that he did not come under the law prescribing that Nazirites not touch dead bodies. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nu 6:2-9</a>) It should also be noted that this law applied to persons who <em>voluntarily</em> took a vow of Naziriteship; but in Samson’s case, the requirements that applied were those specifically stated to his mother by Jehovah’s angel.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">When old enough to marry, Samson requested that his parents get a certain Philistine woman from Timnah for him as a wife. This was in harmony with the direction of God’s spirit, as it was to provide occasion for Samson to fight against the Philistines. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 13:25–14:4</a>) Subsequently, near Timnah, a maned young lion confronted Samson. Empowered by God’s spirit, he tore the animal in two with his bare hands. He then continued on his way to Timnah and there spoke with the Philistine woman whom he wanted as a wife.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 14:5-7</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Sometime later Samson, accompanied by his parents, went to Timnah to bring his betrothed home. On the way there he turned aside from the road to look at the corpse of the lion that he had killed earlier and found a swarm of bees and honey inside. Samson ate some of the honey and, upon rejoining his parents, offered honey to them. At the wedding banquet he made this incident an object of a riddle and propounded it to 30 Philistine groomsmen. Further developments centering around this riddle provided the occasion for Samson to kill 30 Philistines at Ashkelon.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 14:8-19</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">When the father of his betrothed gave her to another man and did not permit Samson to see her, Samson was furnished with yet another opportunity to act against the Philistines. Using 300 foxes, he set the grainfields, vineyards, and olive groves of the Philistines on fire. The enraged Philistines therefore burned Samson’s betrothed and her father, because the Philistines’ loss had resulted from his treatment of Samson. By this act the Philistines once more gave Samson reason for avenging himself upon them. He slew many of them, “piling legs upon thighs.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 14:20–15:8</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Seeking revenge against Samson, the Philistines came to Lehi. Three thousand fearful men of Judah then prevailed upon Samson at the crag Etam to surrender, thereafter binding him with two new ropes and leading him to the Philistines. Exultantly, the Philistines prepared to receive Samson. But “Jehovah’s spirit became operative upon <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>him, and the ropes that were upon his arms came to be like linen threads that have been scorched with fire, so that his fetters melted off his hands.” Taking the moist jawbone of a male ass, Samson struck down a thousand men, after which he ascribed this victory to Jehovah. On that occasion Jehovah, in answer to Samson’s request, miraculously provided water to relieve his thirst.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 15:9-19</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Another time Samson went to the home of a prostitute in the Philistine city of Gaza. Hearing of this, the Philistines laid in wait for him, intending to kill him in the morning. But at midnight Samson got up and ripped the city gate and its side posts and bar from the wall of Gaza, and he carried them “up to the top of the mountain that is in front of Hebron.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 16:1-3</a>; see <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GAZA</a> No. 1.) This was a great humiliation for the Philistines, as it left Gaza weak and unprotected from intruders. The fact that Samson was able to accomplish this amazing feat indicates that he still had God’s spirit. This would argue against his having gone to the house of the prostitute for immoral purposes. In Lange’s <em>Commentary on the Holy Scriptures</em> (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 16:1</a>, p. 212), commentator Paulus Cassel says on this point: “Samson did not come to Gaza for the purpose of visiting a harlot: for it is said that ‘he went, thither, and saw there a [prostitute].’ But when he wished to remain there [at Gaza] over night, there was nothing for him, the national enemy, but to abide with the [prostitute]. . . . His stay is spoken of in language not different from that employed with reference to the abode of the spies in the house of Rahab. The words, ‘he saw her,’ only indicate that when he saw a woman of her class, he knew where he could find shelter for the night.” (Translated and edited by P. Schaff, 1976) It should also be noted that the account reads “Samson kept lying till midnight” and not ‘Samson kept lying <em>with her</em> till midnight.’</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">By going into enemy territory, Samson demonstrated his fearlessness. It may well be that he went to Gaza to ‘look for an opportunity against the Philistines,’ as had been the case earlier when he sought a wife among them. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 14:4</a>) If so, Samson apparently intended to turn any effort directed against him into an occasion for inflicting injury upon the Philistines.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Betrayed by Delilah.</strong> It was after this that Samson fell in love with Delilah. (See <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DELILAH</a>.) For material gain she sought to learn the secret of Samson’s strength. Three times he gave her misleading answers. But, because of her persistent pestering, he finally gave in and revealed to her that his strength lay in his being a Nazirite from birth. She then got in touch with the Philistines to get the reward for turning him over to them. While Samson was sleeping on her knees, Delilah had his hair shaved off. Upon awakening, he no longer had Jehovah’s spirit, for he had allowed himself to get into a position that led to the termination of his Naziriteship. Not the hair itself, but what it stood for, that is, Samson’s special relationship with Jehovah as a Nazirite, was the source of his strength. With the end of that relationship, Samson was no different from any other man. Therefore, the Philistines were able to blind him, bind him with copper fetters, and put him to work as a grinder in the prison house.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 16:4-21</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">While Samson languished in prison, the Philistines arranged for a great sacrifice to their god Dagon, to whom they attributed their success in having captured Samson. Great throngs, including all the axis lords, were assembled in the house used for Dagon worship. On the roof alone there were 3,000 men and women. The merry Philistines had Samson, whose hair had meanwhile grown luxuriantly, brought out of prison to provide amusement for them. Upon his arrival, Samson asked the boy who was leading him to let him feel the pillars that supported the structure. He then prayed to Jehovah: “Remember me, please, and strengthen me, please, just this once, O you the true God, and let me avenge myself upon the Philistines with vengeance for one of my two eyes.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/11/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 16:22-28</a>) It may be that he prayed to avenge himself for only one of his eyes because of recognizing that the loss of them had come about partly through his own failure. Or, it may be that he felt it would be impossible to avenge himself completely as Jehovah’s representative.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Samson braced himself against the two supporting pillars and “bent himself with power,” causing the house to collapse. This resulted in his own death and that of more Philistines than he had killed in his entire lifetime. Relatives buried him “between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial place of Manoah his father.” Thus Samson died faithful to Jehovah after having judged Israel for 20 years. Therefore his name rightly appears among men who, through faith, were made powerful.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 15:20;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/12/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 16:29-31;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003823/12/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Heb 11:32-34</a>.</p>"

Between the two mountains is a fertile valley, the Valley of Shechem, in which present-day Nablus is situated. Shechem, a strong and important city of Canaan before the Israelites entered the Promised Land, stood at the eastern end of the valley, about 1.5 km (1 mi) SE of Nablus.

                "<p class=\"sb\">In harmony with instructions given by Moses, the tribes of Israel assembled at Mounts Gerizim and Ebal under Joshua’s direction shortly after their conquest of Ai. There the people heard the reading of the blessings they would receive if they obeyed Jehovah and the maledictions that awaited them if they disobeyed him. The tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin stood in front of Mount Gerizim. The Levites and the ark of the covenant were situated in the valley, and the other six tribes stood in front of Mount Ebal.

While it has been suggested that the blessings were read toward Mount Gerizim because of its greater beauty and fertility in contrast with rocky, largely barren Mount Ebal, the Bible does not furnish any information on this matter.

The psalmist on one occasion uses the earlier name, “Salem.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 76:2</a>) Other appellations were: “city of Jehovah” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 60:14</a>), “town of the grand King” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 48:2</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 5:35</a>), “City of Righteousness” and “Faithful Town” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 1:26</a>), “Zion” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 33:20</a>), and “holy city” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ne 11:1;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Isa 48:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 52:1;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Mt 4:5</a>). The name “el Quds,” meaning “the Holy [City],” is still the popular name for it in Arabic. The name shown on present-day maps of Israel is Yerushalayim.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Location.</strong> Comparatively remote from principal international trade routes, Jerusalem lay on the edge of an arid wilderness (the Wilderness of Judah), its water supplies being limited. Nevertheless, two <em>internal</em> trade routes did intersect near the city. One ran in a N-S direction along the top of the plateau forming the “backbone” of ancient Palestine, and this route linked together such cities as Dothan, Shechem, Bethel, Bethlehem, Hebron, and Beer-sheba. The second route ran in an E-W direction from Rabbah (modern ʽAmman), cut through torrent valleys to the Jordan River basin, ascended the steep Judean slopes, and then wound down the western slopes to the Mediterranean Coast and the seaport town of Joppa. Additionally, Jerusalem was centrally located for the whole area of the Promised Land, hence appropriate for a state administration center.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Lying about 55 km (34 mi) inland from the Mediterranean Sea and some 25 km (16 mi) due W of the northern end of the Dead Sea, Jerusalem rests among the hills of the central mountain range. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 125:2</a>.) Its altitude of about 750 m (2,500 ft) above sea level made it one of the highest capital cities in the world at that time. Its “loftiness” is mentioned in the Scriptures, and travelers had to ‘go up’ from the coastal plains to reach the city. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 48:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/10/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 122:3, 4</a>) The climate is pleasant, with cool nights, an average annual temperature of 17° C. (63° F.), and an average annual rainfall of about 63 cm (25 in.), the rain falling mainly between November and April.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Despite its height, Jerusalem does not stand up above the surrounding terrain. The traveler gets a full view of the city only when quite close. To the E, the Mount of Olives rises about 800 m (2,620 ft). North of it, Mount Scopus reaches about 820 m (2,690 ft), and the encircling hills on the S and W rise as high as 835 m (2,740 ft). These elevations give a view of the situation in relation to the Temple Mount (c. 740 m [2,430 ft]).</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In times of war, this situation would seem to constitute a serious disadvantage. Any drawback, however, was compensated for by the city’s being surrounded on three sides by steep-walled valleys: the torrent valley of Kidron on the east and <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>the Valley of Hinnom on the south and west. A central valley, apparently referred to by Josephus as the Tyropoeon Valley (or “the Valley of the Cheesemakers”), bisected the city area into eastern and western hills or spurs. (<em>The Jewish War,</em> V, 136, 140 [iv, 1]) This central valley has filled in considerably throughout the centuries, but a visitor still must make a rather sharp descent to a central hollow and then climb up the other side when crossing the city. There is evidence that, in addition to the N-S central valley, two smaller E-W valleys, or depressions, further divided the hills, one cutting across the eastern hill and the other across the western.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The steep valley walls seem to have been incorporated into the city’s defensive wall system in all periods. The only side of the city lacking in natural defense was that on the N, and here the walls were made especially strong. When attacking the city in 70 C.E., General Titus, according to Josephus, was faced with three successive walls on that side.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Water Supply.</strong> Jerusalem’s inhabitants suffered from serious food shortages in siege, but evidently had no great water problem. For, in spite of its nearness to the arid Judean Wilderness, the city had access to a constant supply of fresh water and had adequate storage facilities within the city walls.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Two springs, En-rogel and Gihon, were located near the city. The first lay a little S of the junction of the Kidron and Hinnom valleys. While a valuable source of water, its position made it inaccessible during times of attack or siege. The Gihon spring lay on the W side of the Kidron Valley, alongside what came to be called the City of David. Though outside the city walls, it was close enough that a tunnel could be excavated connecting to a shaft, enabling the city’s inhabitants to draw water without going outside the protective walls. This was done early in the city’s history, according to the archaeological evidence. In 1961 and 1962, excavations revealed a substantial early wall, situated <em>below</em> the upper end, or entrance, of the tunnel, hence enclosing it. It is thought to be the wall of the old Jebusite city.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Over the years, additional tunnels and canals were formed to channel Gihon’s waters. One channel ran from the mouth of the cave of the Gihon spring down the valley and around the end of the SE hill to a pool located at the junction of the Hinnom Valley with the central or Tyropoeon Valley. According to what has been found, it was in the form of a trench, covered with flat stones, and tunneled through the hillside at points. Openings at intervals allowed for water to be drawn off for irrigation of the valley terraces below. The canal’s gradient of about 4 or 5 millimeters per meter (less than 0.2 in. per yd) produced a slow gentle flow, reminding one of “the waters of the Shiloah that are going gently.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/11/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 8:6</a>) It is suggested that this canal, unprotected and vulnerable, was constructed during Solomon’s reign, when peace and security were predominant.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jerusalem’s homes and buildings were evidently equipped with underground cisterns, supplementing the supply of water from springs. Rainwater collected from the roofs was stored therein, kept clean and cool. The temple area seems to have had particularly large cisterns, archaeologists claiming to have plotted 37 cisterns there with a total capacity of about 38,000 kl (10,000,000 gal), one cistern alone estimated as capable of holding 7,600 kl (2,000,000 gal).</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Over the centuries a number of aqueducts, or conduits, were built, in order to provide water for Jerusalem. Tradition ascribes to Solomon the construction of a conduit from the “Pools of Solomon” (three reservoirs SW of Bethlehem) to the temple enclosure at Jerusalem. At <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ecclesiastes 2:6</a>, Solomon says: “I made pools of water for myself, to irrigate with them the forest.” Such a large undertaking as the building of the pools could well have included the building of a conduit for the larger supply of water that would be needed at Jerusalem after the temple services were instituted. However, there is no evidence, other than tradition, to support the Solomonic origin of a conduit from the Pools of Solomon to Jerusalem. A number of aqueducts can still be traced. One conduit constructed to carry water from springs in the Wadi el-ʽArrub 20 km (12 mi) SSW of Jerusalem to the Pools of Solomon is possibly the one alluded to by Josephus, who says that it was constructed by Pontius Pilate with temple treasury funds. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XVIII, 60 [iii, 2]; <em>The Jewish War,</em> II, 175 [ix, 4]) Of the two aqueducts leading from the Pools of Solomon to Jerusalem, the lower one is the older, possibly dating from the time of Herod or of the Hasmonaeans. This aqueduct passed under the village of Bethlehem and ran on to the Temple Mount over “Wilson’s Arch.”</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Archaeological Research.</strong> Though much research and excavation have been carried out, few concrete facts have been determined as to the city of Bible times. Various factors have restricted investigation or limited its value. Jerusalem has had almost continuous occupation in the Common Era, thus severely reducing the area available for excavation. <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>Then, too, the city was destroyed a number of times, with new cities built on top of the ruins and often made, in part, from material of those ruins. The piling up of debris and rubble, in some places about 30 m (100 ft) deep, has obscured the early contours of the site and made the interpretation of the excavated evidence a precarious task. Some wall sections, pools, water tunnels, and ancient tombs have been unearthed, but very little written material. Principal archaeological discoveries have come from the SE hill, which now lies outside the city walls.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The main sources of information regarding the ancient city, therefore, remain the Bible and the description of the first-century city given by Jewish historian Josephus.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Early History.</strong> The first historical mention of the city comes in the decade between 1943 and 1933 B.C.E., when Abraham’s encounter with Melchizedek took place. Melchizedek was “king of Salem” and “priest of the Most High God.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 14:17-20</a>) However, the origins of the city and of the population that composed it are as wrapped in obscurity as is the origin of its king-priest Melchizedek.​—Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heb 7:1-3</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Apparently another event in Abraham’s life involved the vicinity of Jerusalem. Abraham was commanded to offer up his son Isaac on “one of the mountains” in “the land of Moriah.” The temple built by Solomon was erected on “Mount Moriah” on a site that previously had been a threshing floor. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/15/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 22:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/15/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2Ch 3:1</a>) Thus, the Bible apparently links the place of Abraham’s attempted sacrifice with the mountainous region around Jerusalem. (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MORIAH</a>.) Whether Melchizedek was still living then is not revealed; but Salem likely remained friendly territory for Abraham.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The Amarna Tablets, written by Canaanite rulers to their Egyptian overlord, include seven letters from the king or governor of Jerusalem (Urusalim). These letters were written prior to the Israelite conquest of Canaan. Thus, Jerusalem, in the approximately 465-year period between Abraham’s meeting with Melchizedek and the Israelite conquest, had become the possession of pagan Hamitic Canaanites and was under the domination of the Hamitic Egyptian Empire.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The account of Joshua’s sweeping conquest of Canaan lists Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, among the confederate kings attacking Gibeon. His name (meaning “(My) Lord Is Righteousness”) closely parallels that of Jerusalem’s earlier King Melchizedek (“King of Righteousness”), but Adoni-zedek was no worshiper of the Most High God, Jehovah.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 10:1-5,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 23,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 26;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12:7, 8,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 10</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In the allotting of tribal territories, Jerusalem was on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin, the specific border running along the Valley of Hinnom. This would place at least what comprised the later “City of David,” situated on the ridge between the Kidron and Tyropoeon valleys, within the territory of Benjamin. Apparently the Canaanite city had additional settlements, or “suburbs,” however, and part of the settled area may have overlapped into Judah’s territory to the W and S of the Valley of Hinnom. Judah is credited with the initial capture of Jerusalem at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Judges 1:8</a>, but after the invading forces moved on, the Jebusite inhabitants apparently remained (or returned) in sufficient force to form a later pocket of resistance that neither Judah nor Benjamin could break. Thus, of both Judah and Benjamin it is said that the ‘Jebusites continued dwelling with them in Jerusalem.’ (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/18/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 15:63;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/18/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Jg 1:21</a>) This situation continued for some four centuries, and the city was at times referred to as “Jebus,” “a city of foreigners.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 19:10-12;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/19/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1Ch 11:4, 5</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>During the United Kingdom.</strong> King Saul’s headquarters were at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin. King David’s capital city was first at Hebron in Judah, about 30 km (19 mi) SSW of Jerusalem. After ruling there a total of seven and a half years (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:5</a>), he determined to transfer the capital to Jerusalem. This was by divine direction (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/21/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ch 6:4-6</a>), Jehovah having spoken centuries earlier of the ‘site where He would choose to place his name.’​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/22/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 12:5;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/22/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 26:2</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/23/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ch 7:12</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">It seems that the Jebusites at that time had their city on the southern end of the eastern spur. They were confident of the impregnability of their fortress city, with its natural defenses of steep valley walls on three sides and, probably, special fortifications on the north. It was known as “the place difficult to approach” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/24/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ch 11:7</a>), and the Jebusites taunted David that even ‘the blind and the lame of the city’ could hold off his attacks. But David conquered the city, his attack being spearheaded by Joab, who evidently gained entry into the city by means of “the water tunnel.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/25/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:6-9;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/25/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1Ch 11:4-8</a>) Scholars are not entirely certain of the meaning of the Hebrew term here rendered “water tunnel,” but generally accept this or similar terms (“water shaft,” <em>RS, AT;</em> “gutter,” <em>JP</em>) as the most likely meaning. The brief account does not state just how the city’s defenses were breached. Since the discovery of the tunnel and shaft leading to the Gihon spring, the popular view is that Joab led men up this vertical shaft, through the sloping tunnel and into the city in a surprise attack. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 951) By whatever means, the city was taken and David <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>moved his capital there (1070 B.C.E.). The Jebusite stronghold now came to be known as “the City of David,” also called “Zion.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/26/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:7</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">David began a building program within the area, apparently also improving the city’s defenses.

When David later transferred the sacred “ark of Jehovah” from the house of Obed-edom to Jerusalem, the city became the religious, as well as administrative, center of the nation.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/30/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 6:11, 12,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/30/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 17</a>; see <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BURIAL, BURIAL PLACES</a>; <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DAVID, CITY OF</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MOUND</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">There is no record of Jerusalem’s being attacked by enemy forces during David’s reign, as he carried the battle to his foes.

On one occasion, however, David saw fit to abandon the city before the advance of rebel forces led by his own son, Absalom. The king’s retreat may have been to avoid having blood shed in civil war at this place where Jehovah’s name rested. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/32/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 15:13-17</a>) Whatever the motive for the retreat, it led to the fulfillment of the inspired prophecy spoken by Nathan.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Toward the close of his rule, David began preparing construction materials for the temple.

The hewn stones prepared may have been quarried in that area, for the bedrock of Jerusalem itself is easily cut and chiseled to size and shape, yet, upon exposure to the weather, hardens into durable and attractive building stones.

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Hellenic and Maccabean Control.</strong> The changeover from Medo-Persian to Greek control came in 332 B.C.E. when Alexander the Great marched through Judah. The Greek historians make no mention of Alexander’s entry into Jerusalem. Yet the city did come under Greek dominion, and it is reasonable to assume that it was not completely bypassed by Alexander. Josephus, in the first century C.E., records the Jewish tradition that, upon approaching Jerusalem, Alexander was met by the Jewish high priest and was shown the divinely inspired prophecies recorded by Daniel foretelling the lightning conquests by Greece. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XI, 326-338 [viii, 4, 5]; <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/86/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Da 8:5-7,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/86/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 20, 21</a>) Whatever the case, Jerusalem seems to have survived the change in control free of any damage.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Following Alexander’s death, Jerusalem and Judea came under the control of the Ptolemies, who ruled out of Egypt. In 198 B.C.E. Antiochus the Great, ruling in Syria, after taking the fortified city of Sidon, captured Jerusalem, and Judea became a dominion of the Seleucid Empire. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/87/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Da 11:16</a>.) Jerusalem lay under Seleucid rule for 30 years. Then, in the year 168 B.C.E., Syrian King Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), in his attempt to Hellenize completely the Jews, dedicated Jerusalem’s temple to Zeus (Jupiter) and profaned the altar by an unclean sacrifice. (1 Maccabees 1:57, 62; 2 Maccabees 6:1, 2, 5; PICTURES, Vol. 2, p. 335) This led to the Maccabean (or Hasmonaean) revolt. After a three-year struggle, Judas Maccabaeus gained control of the city and temple and <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>rededicated Jehovah’s altar to true worship on the anniversary of its profanation, Chislev 25, 165 B.C.E.​—1 Maccabees 4:52-54; 2 Maccabees 10:5; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/88/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 10:22</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The war against the Seleucid rulers had not ended. The Jews appealed to Rome for help and thus a new power came on the Jerusalem scene in about 160 B.C.E. (1 Maccabees 8:17, 18) Now Jerusalem began to come under the influence of the expanding Roman Empire. About 142 B.C.E., Simon Maccabaeus was able to make Jerusalem the capital of a region ostensibly free from subservience to or taxation by Gentile nations. Aristobulus I, Jerusalem’s high priest, even assumed the title of king in 104 B.C.E. He was not, however, of the Davidic line.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jerusalem was no ‘city of peace’ during this period. Internal quarrels, fired by selfish ambitions and worsened by rival religious factions​—Sadducees, Pharisees, Zealots, and others—​gravely weakened the city. A violent quarrel between Aristobulus II and his brother Hyrcanus resulted in Rome’s being called on to arbitrate the dispute. Under General Pompey, Roman forces besieged Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. for three months in order to enter the city and settle the dispute. Twelve thousand Jews reportedly died, many at the hands of fellow Israelites.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">It is in Josephus’ account of Pompey’s conquest that the archway across the Tyropoeon Valley is first mentioned. It served as a link between the eastern and western halves of the city and gave those on the western half direct access to the temple area.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The Idumean Antipater (II) was now installed as Roman governor for Judea, a Maccabean being left as high priest and local ethnarch in Jerusalem. Later, Antipater’s son Herod (the Great) was appointed by Rome as “king” over Judea. He did not get control of Jerusalem until 37 or 36 B.C.E., from which date his rule effectively began.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Under Herod the Great.</strong> Herod’s rule was marked by an ambitious building program, and the city enjoyed considerable prosperity. A theater, gymnasium, and hippodrome (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 535), as well as other public buildings, were added. Herod also built a well-fortified royal palace (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 538), evidently on the W side of the city S of the present-day Jaffa Gate, where archaeologists believe they have found the foundation of one of the towers. Another fortress, the Tower of Antonia, lay near the temple and was connected with it by a passageway. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 535; <em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XV, 424 [xi, 7]) The Roman garrison could thus gain quick access to the temple area, as likely occurred when soldiers rescued Paul from a mob there.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/89/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ac 21:31, 32</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Herod’s greatest work, however, was the reconstruction of the temple and its building complex. Beginning in his 18th year (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XV, 380 [xi, 1]), the holy house itself was completed in a year and a half, but the work on the adjoining buildings and courtyards went on long after his death. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/90/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 2:20</a>) The total area encompassed was about double that of the previous temple area. Part of the wall of the temple courtyard apparently still stands, known today as the Western Wall, or the Wailing Wall. Archaeologists date the lower courses of huge 0.9-m-high (3 ft) blocks as from Herod’s construction.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>From 2 B.C.E. to 70 C.E.</strong> The Christian Greek Scriptures now carry forward the description of events involving Jerusalem. Jesus’ birth took place, not at Jerusalem, but at nearby Bethlehem, “David’s city.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/91/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 2:10, 11</a>) Nevertheless, the astrologers’ later report about the birth of the “king of the Jews” caused Herod and “all Jerusalem along with him” to become agitated. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/92/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 2:1-3</a>) Shortly after issuing his infamous decree ordering the killing of Bethlehem’s babes, Herod died, evidently in the year 1 B.C.E. (See <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/11\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HEROD</a> No. 1.) His son Archelaus inherited rulership over Jerusalem and Judea as well as other areas. Rome later removed Archelaus for misdemeanors; thereafter governors who were directly appointed by Rome ruled, as did Pontius Pilate during Jesus’ ministry.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/93/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 3:1</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jesus was taken to Jerusalem 40 days after birth and presented at the temple as Mary’s firstborn. Aged Simeon and Anna rejoiced at seeing the promised Messiah, and Anna spoke of him “to all those waiting for Jerusalem’s deliverance.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/94/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 2:21-38</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/95/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Le 12:2-4</a>.) How many other times he was taken to Jerusalem during his childhood years is not stated, only one visit, made when he was 12, being specifically recorded. He then engaged in a discussion with teachers in the temple area, thus being occupied in the ‘house of his Father,’ in the chosen city of his Father.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/96/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 2:41-49</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">After his baptism and during his three-and-a-half-year ministry Jesus periodically visited Jerusalem; he certainly was there for the three annual festivals, attendance at which was obligatory for all Jewish males.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Aside from the temple area, where Jesus frequently taught, few other specific points in the <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>city are mentioned in connection with his ministry. The Pool of Bethzatha with its five colonnades (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/98/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 5:2</a>) is thought to be the one that was unearthed just N of the temple area.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Six days prior to the Passover festival of 33 C.E., Jesus came to Bethany, on the eastern side of the Mount of Olives. The next day, Nisan 9, as Jehovah’s anointed King, he approached the capital city, mounted on the colt of an ass, in fulfillment of the prophecy of <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/100/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zechariah 9:9</a>.

Though many of her citizens showed faith in God’s Son, the city as a whole continued to follow the pattern of the past. For this, ‘her house was abandoned to her.’ (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/129/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 23:38</a>) In 66 C.E. a Jewish revolt brought Roman forces under Cestius Gallus to the city, surrounding it and making a thrust right up to the temple walls. Suddenly Cestius Gallus withdrew for no apparent reason. This allowed Christians to put into action Jesus’ instructions: “Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains, and let those in the midst of [Jerusalem] withdraw, and let those in the country places not enter into her.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/130/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 21:20-22</a>) Eusebius, in his <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> (III, V, 3), states that the Christians fled from Jerusalem and the whole land of Judea to a city of Perea that was called Pella.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jerusalem’s relief as a result of the Roman withdrawal was short-lived, as it had been when the Babylonians temporarily withdrew to deal with the Egyptians near the end of King Zedekiah’s reign. Under General Titus the Roman forces returned in 70 C.E. in increased numbers and laid siege to the city, now crowded with Passover celebrants. Siege banks were thrown up by the Romans, and a continuous wall or fence was erected around the entire city to prevent escape by day or night. This, too, fulfilled Jesus’ prophecy. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/131/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 19:43</a>) Within the city rival factions quarreled and fought, much of the food supply was destroyed, and those caught attempting to leave the city were slain as traitors. Josephus, the source of this information, relates that in time the famine became so grave that the people were reduced to eating wisps of hay and leather, even their own children. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/132/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">La 2:11, 12,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/132/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 19, 20;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/132/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> De 28:56, 57</a>.) Titus’ offers of peace were consistently rejected by the stubborn city leaders.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Eventually the walls were systematically breached by the Romans, and their troops invaded the city. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 752) Despite orders to the contrary, the temple was burned and gutted. According to Josephus, this took place on the anniversary of Nebuchadnezzar’s destruction of the first temple centuries earlier. His account also states that the repository of the archives, housing the genealogical records of tribal and family descent and inheritance rights, was put to the fire. (<em>The Jewish War,</em> VI, 250, 251 [iv, 5]; II, 426-428 [xvii, 6]; VI, 354 [vi, 3]) Thus, the legal means for establishing the lineage of members of the Messianic tribe of Judah and the priestly tribe of Levi came to an end.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In just 4 months and 25 days, from April 3 to August 30, 70 C.E., the conquest had been effected. Thus, the tribulation, though intense, was remarkably short. The unreasoning attitude and actions of the Jews within the city doubtless <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>contributed to this shortness. Though Josephus puts the number of dead at 1,100,000, there were survivors. Ninety-seven thousand captives were taken, many of whom were sent as slaves to Egypt or were killed by sword or beasts in the theaters of the Roman provinces. This, too, fulfilled divine prophecy.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/133/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 28:68</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The entire city was demolished, with only the towers of Herod’s palace and a portion of the western wall left standing as evidence to later generations of the defensive strength that had availed nothing. Josephus remarks that, apart from these remnants, “the rest of the wall encompassing the city was so completely levelled to the ground as to leave future visitors to the spot no ground for believing that it had ever been inhabited.” (<em>The Jewish War,</em> VII, 3 [i, 1]) A relief on the Arch of Titus in Rome depicts Roman soldiers carrying off sacred vessels of the ruined temple.​—Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/134/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 24:2</a>; PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 752.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Later Periods.</strong> Jerusalem remained virtually desolate until about 130 C.E., when Emperor Hadrian ordered the building of a new city, named Aelia Capitolina. This provoked a Jewish revolt by Bar Kokhba (132-135 C.E.), which succeeded for a time but was then crushed. Jews were not allowed in the Roman-built city for nearly two centuries. In the fourth century, Constantine the Great’s mother Helena visited Jerusalem and began the identification of the many so-called holy sites and shrines. Later the Muslims captured the city. Today there are two Islamic structures on the Temple Mount. Late in the seventh century Caliph ʽAbd al-Malik ibn Marwan built the Dome of the Rock on or near the temple site. Although also called a mosque, it is in reality a shrine. South of the Dome of the Rock is the el-Aqsa mosque, first constructed in the eighth century, but largely rebuilt in the eleventh century.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>The City’s Significance.</strong> Jerusalem was far more than the capital of an earthly nation. It was the only city in all the earth upon which Jehovah God placed his name.

When the Benjamites refused to hand over the guilty men of that city, full-scale war erupted. Finally, the tribe of Benjamin was almost annihilated; only 600 able-bodied men escaped.

One of these was the giving of 400 virgin girls from Jabesh-gilead to the Benjamites. The rest of the population of that city had been destroyed, because none of its inhabitants had come to Mizpah and supported the fight against Benjamin.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003093/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 21:5-12</a>.</p>",

When word about their assembly at Mizpah reached the Philistines, they took advantage of the situation to launch an attack. But Jehovah threw the enemy into confusion, enabling the Israelites to subdue the foe. Apparently to commemorate this God-given victory, Samuel erected a stone between Mizpah and Jeshanah, calling it Ebenezer (meaning “Stone of Help”). Thereafter Samuel continued judging Israel and, as he did so, made a yearly circuit of Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah.

Gedaliah administered affairs from Mizpah. There the prophet Jeremiah took up residence. Also, surviving army chiefs and other Jews who had been scattered came to Mizpah. Governor Gedaliah, although having been forewarned, failed to exercise caution and was assassinated at Mizpah. Chaldeans and Jews with him there were likewise slaughtered. Thereafter 70 visiting men also met their death. The band of assassins, led by Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, took the rest of the people captive.

The Moabite defeat even provided the basis for a taunting proverbial saying, either of Amorite or Israelite origin.

But, if originating with the Israelites, it signified that just as Sihon had wrested Heshbon from the Moabites, so Israel would take this and other cities from the Amorites.

It is also noteworthy that the Ramses to whom the scarab should be assigned cannot be definitely ascertained.

One of these letters, evidently directed by a military outpost to the commander at Lachish, reads in part: “We are watching for the signals of Lachish, according to all the indications which my lord hath given, for we cannot see Azekah.” This message suggests that Azekah had already been taken so that no signals were received from there.

                "<p class=\"sb\">There are apparently two accounts of Israel’s first conquest of Debir as part of Joshua’s military operations. The first account simply states that Debir’s population was annihilated. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 10:38, 39</a>) The second, <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joshua 11:21-23</a>, is likely a recapitulation of the same conquest (since <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">verse 18</a> refers to the ‘many days when Joshua waged war with all these kings’), while supplying the additional information that Joshua “cut off the Anakim . . . from Debir” and other cities. This supplementary material may have been included to show that even the tall Anakim, who had struck such fear in the hearts of Israel’s spies more than 40 years earlier (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nu 13:28,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/9/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 31-33;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/9/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> De 9:2</a>), had not proved invulnerable.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Nevertheless, it appears that the Anakim reestablished themselves in the city of Debir, perhaps coming in from the Philistine coast (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 11:22</a>) while Israel was temporarily at its Gilgal camp or was warring in the N. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/11/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 10:43–11:15</a>) Though Joshua’s initial campaigns had served to subdue the unified resistance of enemy forces in the land of Canaan, rapidly demolishing all major strongholds, apparently this type of warfare did not allow for the establishing of garrisons to hold the sites of all the destroyed cities. So, a second conquest or “mopping up” operation was effected at Debir by Othniel, who, because of distinguishing himself in the city’s conquest, was given Achsah, the daughter of veteran warrior Caleb, as a wife.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 15:13-19;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/12/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Jg 1:11-15</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">It cannot be ascertained precisely when in Israel’s history this second conquest occurred. The book of Judges opens with the phrase <em>“after</em> the death of Joshua,” and the account of Caleb’s taking Debir follows thereafter. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 1:11-15</a>) This, according to some, would make Judah’s conquest of Debir subsequent to Joshua’s death and would mean that the similar account found at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joshua 15:13-19</a> was a later addition to the book bearing Joshua’s name. However, others view <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/15/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Judges 1:1</a> as only a formal introduction to connect it with the book of Joshua, arguing that Caleb would hardly wait for years until Joshua died before driving the Anakim from his promised possession. Hence, they consider the Judges account to be a restatement of that in Joshua.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Various suggestions have been put forth by Biblical scholars regarding the location of Debir in the mountainous region of Judah. In the past it was identified with Tell Beit Mirsim, about 20 km <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>(12 mi) WSW of Hebron. However, now it is identified with Khirbet Rabud, about 13 km (8 mi) SW of Hebron.</p>",

The inhabitants of the region are therefore spoken of prophetically as going “up to The House and to Dibon, to the high places,” mourning the desolation of Moab.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Certain scholars have theorized that Isaiah alluded to the threatening Assyrian menace as causing the “weeping” at “the high places” near Dibon; however, there is no record of an Assyrian devastation of that region. When Jehovah’s servant Jeremiah prophesied about a hundred years <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>later that Dibon would “get down from glory, and sit down in thirst” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001172/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jer 48:18</a>), Isaiah’s earlier prophecy had apparently not yet been fulfilled. Therefore the later prophet was evidently presenting anew a similar message and thereby making the prediction of doom on Moab doubly certain. Sometime after the fall of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E., when Nebuchadnezzar thoroughly devastated Moab, he may have left Dibon’s citizens, not only ‘thirsting’ for the luxuries of its previous glory but also forsaken as humbled captives, literally thirsting for water and other common necessities.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001172/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jer 25:9,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001172/8/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 17-21</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The finding of large stores of remarkably preserved grain at Dibon, which grain is considered to date back to sometime in the latter half of the first millennium B.C.E., seems to confirm the view of some that the Dibon region, even today an agriculturally productive area, may have at one time been a breadbasket of Palestine.</p>",

However, both Dan and Beer-sheba were situated at natural frontiers of the land. In the case of Beer-sheba, its position was below the mountains of Judah on the edge of the desert. Additionally, it was one of the principal cities of Judah (along with Jerusalem and Hebron), and this was not only because it had an excellent supply of water as compared with the surrounding region, thus allowing for both farming and grazing of herds and flocks, but also because important roads converged on it from several directions. From Egypt an ancient route led up by the “Way of the Wells” through Kadesh-barnea to Beer-sheba, being joined by another road over which traveled the camel caravans from the “Spice Kingdoms” of the Arabian Peninsula, heading for Philistia or Judah. From Ezion-geber, at the head of the Gulf of ʽAqaba, another route led up through the Arabah and then turned W, climbing the Ascent of Akrabbim to Beer-sheba. At Gaza, in the Philistine Plain, a road branching from the highway led SE to Beer-sheba. And, connecting it with the rest of Judah, a road ran from Beer-sheba to the NE, climbing the plateau up into the mountains of Judah to Jerusalem and points farther N.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 22:19</a>.</p>",

He and Phicol the chief of his army approached Abraham to propose a covenant of peace. When Abraham severely criticized Abimelech for his servants’ act of violence in seizing the well, Abimelech avowed his ignorance, concluded a covenant with Abraham, and accepted seven female lambs from him in evidence of Abraham’s title to the well. “That is why [Abraham] called that place Beer-sheba, because there both of them had taken an oath.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 21:31</a>) Abraham then planted a tamarisk tree there and called upon “the name of Jehovah the indefinitely lasting God.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 21:33</a>) It was from Beer-sheba that Abraham went to Moriah to offer Isaac as a sacrifice, and he returned there to dwell.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 22:19</a>.</p>",

After feasting and drinking, they arose early the next morning and made sworn statements one to the other. That same day the well produced water, and Isaac called its name Shibah, meaning “Oath; or, Seven” and referring to an oath or statement sworn to by seven things.

Consequently he would normally have inherited two portions in the property of his father Gilead (who apparently was dead at the time Jephthah’s half brothers drove him out) and would also have been the head of the family. Only by illegally driving him away could Jephthah’s half brothers deprive him of his rightful inheritance, for even though the firstborn son of a father was the son of a secondary wife, or even a less-favored wife, he was, nevertheless, to receive the firstborn’s rights.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002413/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 21:15-17</a>.</p>",

His insistence on this was not a selfish demand. He had shown himself concerned with the fight in behalf of God’s name and his people. Now, if he defeated Ammon, it would prove that God was with him. Jephthah wanted to make sure that God’s rule would not be forsaken again once the crisis had passed. Also, if he was indeed Gilead’s firstborn son, he was only establishing his legal right as head of the house of Gilead. The covenant was then concluded before Jehovah in Mizpah. Here again Jephthah showed that he looked to Jehovah as Israel’s God and King and their real Deliverer.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002413/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 11:8-11</a>.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">Jephthah got at the heart of the matter when he showed that the issue revolved around the matter of worship. He declared that Jehovah God had given Israel the land and that for this reason they would not give an inch of it to worshipers of a false god. He called Chemosh the god of Ammon. Some have thought this to be an error. But, although Ammon had the god Milcom, and though Chemosh was a god of Moab, those related nations worshiped many gods. Solomon even wrongly brought the worship of Chemosh into Israel because of his foreign wives.

But this is not the case. It would be an insult to Jehovah, a disgusting thing in violation of his law, to make a literal human sacrifice. He strictly commanded Israel: “You must not learn to do according to the detestable things of those nations. There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire . . .

Besides, the offering of an animal would not show extraordinary devotion to God. Jephthah knew that it might well be his daughter who would come out to meet him. It must be borne in <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>mind that Jehovah’s spirit was on Jephthah at the time; this would prevent any rash vow on Jephthah’s part.

But Jephthah’s daughter “never had relations with a man.” Had these words applied only to the time prior to the carrying out of the vow, they would have been superfluous, for she is specifically said to have been a virgin. That the statement has reference to the fulfilling of the vow is shown in that it follows the expression, “He carried out his vow that he had made toward her.” Actually, the record is pointing out that also <em>after</em> the vow was carried out she maintained her virginity.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002413/34/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 11:39</a>; compare renderings in <em>KJ; Dy; Yg; NW.</em></p>",

Mount Ebal is opposite Mount Gerizim, these mountains being separated by a beautiful, narrow valley, the Vale of Shechem (Nablus Valley), in which nestles the city of Nablus, not far from ancient Shechem. Only its lower slopes sustain such vegetation as vines and olive trees, the higher elevations being quite barren and rocky. Like other mountains in Samaria, Ebal consists of a limestone core with an outer shell of chalk. It stands to the NE of Mount Gerizim and rises to a peak of over 900 m (3,000 ft) above the level of the Mediterranean. Mounts Ebal and Gerizim are situated to the W of the Jordan River.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001245/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 11:29, 30</a>.</p>",

The heights in the vicinity of Jerusalem can be seen to the S, and the Plain of Sharon and the Mediterranean to the W. To the E <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>it is possible to see as far as the Hauran across the Jordan. Abram (Abraham) once camped in the valley between these two mountains, near the big trees of Moreh.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001245/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 12:6</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Moses told the Israelites that when Jehovah brought them into the land that they were going to possess, they “must also give the blessing upon Mount Gerizim and the malediction upon Mount Ebal.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001245/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 11:29, 30</a>) He also instructed that great uncut stones be selected, whitewashed with lime, and set on Mount Ebal. An altar was to be erected there, upon which sacrifices were to be presented to Jehovah. Moses also said, “You must write on the stones all the words of this law, making them quite clear.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001245/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 27:1-8</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">After Israel crossed the Jordan, the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali were to “stand for the malediction on Mount Ebal,” and the other tribes were to “stand to bless the people on Mount Gerizim.” At that time the blessings to be enjoyed by those obeying God’s law, as well as the curses or maledictions to be experienced by those breaking his law, would be recited.

                "<p class=\"sb\">After Israel’s victory at Ai, Joshua complied with Moses’ instructions, building an altar to Jehovah in Mount Ebal. Upon stones (perhaps, but not necessarily, those of the altar itself) he wrote “a copy of the law of Moses that he had written before the sons of Israel.” Then, in front of the congregation of Israel (including the alien residents) assembled as Moses had directed, Joshua “read aloud all the words of the law, the blessing and the malediction, according to all that is written in the book of the law.” Half the congregation stood in front of Mount Ebal and the other half in front of Mount Gerizim, the ark of the covenant and the Levites being between the two groups.

Notably, too, these things occurred approximately in the heart of the land of promise and in the vicinity where Jehovah promised the land to Israel’s forefather Abram (Abraham).​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001245/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 12:6, 7</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jewish tradition holds that the Levites, standing between Mounts Ebal and Gerizim, faced Mount Gerizim when pronouncing a blessing, to which the people assembled there answered “Amen!” Then it is said that they turned to face Mount Ebal and pronounced one of the curses, to which those assembled on that side said “Amen!” The Scriptures, however, do not outline the exact procedure followed on that notable occasion.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">The Hebrew spellings of Geba (masculine form of the word meaning “Hill”) and Gibeah (feminine form of the term meaning “Hill”) are almost identical. Many believe that this has resulted in scribal errors in the Masoretic text and therefore recommend changing certain scriptures to read “Geba” instead of “Gibeah,” and vice versa.

                "<p class=\"sb\">In the period of the Judges, the city of Gibeah figured in an incident that led to the near extermination of the entire tribe of Benjamin. An old man invited an Ephraimite Levite and his concubine to stay with him for the night. Soon good-for-nothing men of Gibeah surrounded the house, demanding that the Levite be turned over to them so that they might have intercourse <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>with him. After the Levite gave his concubine into their hands, they so abused her all night that she died in the morning. (This shocking sin may be alluded to at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001679/15/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ho 9:9</a> and <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001679/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">10:9</a>.) Since the tribe of Benjamin shielded the guilty men of Gibeah, the other tribes warred against Benjamin.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Kadesh is spoken of as being located in both the Wilderness of Paran and the Wilderness of Zin. Possibly Zin and Paran were adjoining wildernesses that met at Kadesh, and therefore, the site could be referred to as lying in either one. Or, the Wilderness of Zin may have been part of the larger Wilderness of Paran.

                "<p class=\"sb\">ʽAin Qedeis, about 80 km (50 mi) SSW of Beer-sheba, has been suggested as a possible identification for Kadesh. In the midst of a desolate wilderness (compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002564/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 1:19</a>), the pure and sweet water of the spring at Qedeis supports an <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>oasis of grass, shrubs, and trees. There are also two other springs in the vicinity, ʽAin el-Qudeirat and ʽAin el-Qeseimeh. Today the largest of the three springs is ʽAin el-Qudeirat, and for this reason some favor identifying it with Kadesh-barnea. However, ʽAin Qedeis is the most easterly spring. Consequently, the identification of ʽAin Qedeis with Kadesh-barnea seems to be more in line with the description of the E-W course of Canaan’s southern boundary: Kadesh-barnea (ʽAin Qedeis?), Hazar-addar (ʽAin el-Qudeirat?), and Azmon (ʽAin el-Qeseimeh?).​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002564/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nu 34:3-5</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">If the Israelites did encamp in this area, because of the vast multitude they doubtless used all three springs. For example, the encampment just before crossing the Jordan spread out “from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002564/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nu 33:49</a>) That was a distance of about 8 km (5 mi), according to the suggested sites for those places. The distance from Kadesh-barnea (ʽAin Qedeis) to Azmon (ʽAin el-Qeseimeh) is about 14 km (8.5 mi); and to Hazar-addar (ʽAin el-Qudeirat) is 9 km (5.5 mi). So, for them to have used all three springs is not an unreasonable possibility. It is also possible that the whole area was called Kadesh-barnea with the name preserved in the SE spring.​—See <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002564/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ADDAR</a> No. 2; <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002564/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AZMON</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In the second year after their Exodus from Egypt, the Israelites pulled away from Hazeroth and encamped at Kadesh-barnea.

Moses then sent 12 men to spy out the Promised Land. Ten of these spies brought back a bad report, resulting in rebellious murmurings among the Israelites. Jehovah, therefore, sentenced the nation to wander in the wilderness. Israel’s subsequent attempt to take Canaan without divine approval and direction brought humiliating defeat.

Earlier he had said to them: “While the Amalekites and the Canaanites are dwelling in the low plain, you people make a turn tomorrow [a Heb. idiom meaning “later on,” as at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002564/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ex 13:14</a>] and pull away to march to the wilderness by way of the Red Sea.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002564/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nu 14:25</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Accordingly, the Israelites left Kadesh-barnea and walked about in the wilderness for 38 years.

(Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002564/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nu 12:16–13:3,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002564/16/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 25, 26;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002564/16/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 33:16-36</a>.)

                "<p class=\"sb\">Finally the Israelites appear to have returned to Kadesh in the first month of the 40th year after the Exodus.

                "<p class=\"sb\">The Philistine cities seem to have been at the peak of their power during the time of King Saul. Before Saul’s kingship the Philistines inflicted a severe defeat upon the Israelites at Ebenezer and captured the ark of the covenant, which they then transported to Ashdod and placed in the temple of Dagon, alongside the image of their god. After two humiliations miraculously executed on Dagon’s image, the Ashdodites began to experience a plague of piles of such gravity as to create panic among them. A conference of Philistine axis lords brought a transfer of the Ark to the city of Gath, with a resulting extension of the plague there. Within seven months the Ark was on its way back to Israel, accompanied by an offering in gold.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000412/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Sa 5:1–6:18</a>; see <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000412/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PHILISTIA, PHILISTINES</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Although King David administered several defeats to the Philistines, their principal cities evidently remained independent until the time of <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>King Uzziah (829-778 B.C.E.). Uzziah is described as the maker of “engines of war” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000412/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ch 26:15</a>), and <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000412/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2 Chronicles 26:6</a> tells us that Uzziah “proceeded to go out and fight against the Philistines and break through the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod, after which he built cities in Ashdod territory and among the Philistines.”</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Evidently the territory of Ashdod did not remain under Judean control, for in later periods inscriptions show Assyrian King Sargon II as deposing the local king Azuri and installing Ahimiti in his place. A revolt caused Sargon to campaign against Philistia, conquering Gath, “Asdudu” (Ashdod), and “Asdudimmu” (Ashdod-by-the-Sea, evidently a separate place located on the seacoast). This may be the campaign referred to at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000412/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isaiah 20:1</a> and a partial fulfillment of the prophecy at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000412/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amos 1:8</a>.

                "<p class=\"sb\">It is noteworthy that the prophecy of Zechariah pointed to the time when Ashdod would be overtaken by foreigners.

Generally, the ancient city is linked with modern Gaza (Ghazzeh; ʽAzza), located about 80 km (50 mi) WSW of Jerusalem. Although separated from the Mediterranean Sea by about 5 km (3 mi) of rolling sand dunes, Gaza lies in a well-watered region known for its olive groves, fruit and sycamore trees, grapevines, and grain. Agriculture likely contributed to the prosperity of ancient Gaza. But its importance stemmed primarily from its location on the main road linking Egypt with Palestine.

                "<p class=\"sb\">The well of Harod has been traditionally identified with ʽAin Jalud (Mayan Harod), a spring rising on the NW spur of Mount Gilboa. Regarding ʽAin Jalud the noted scholar G. A. Smith observed: “It bursts some fifteen feet [less than 5 m] broad and two [0.6 m] deep from the foot of Gilboa, and mainly out of it, but fed also by the other two springs [ʽAin el-Meiyiteh and ʽAin Tubaʽun], it flows strongly enough to work six or seven mills. The deep bed and soft banks of this stream constitute a formidable ditch in front of the position on Gilboa, and render it possible for defenders of the latter to hold the spring at their feet in face of an enemy on the plain: and the spring is indispensable to them, for neither to the left, right, nor rear is other living water. . . . The stream, which makes it possible for the occupiers of the hill to hold also the well against the enemy on the plain, forbids them to be careless in using the water; for they drink in face of that enemy, and the reeds and shrubs which mark its course afford cover for hostile ambushes.”​—<em>The Historical Geography of the Holy Land,</em> London, 1968, p. 258.</p>"

The tribal division to which he belonged was the most insignificant in Manasseh, and he was “the smallest in [his] father’s house.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 6:11,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/0/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 15</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Gideon lived in a very turbulent time of Israel’s history. Because of their unfaithfulness to Jehovah, the Israelites were not enjoying the fruits of their labor. For a number of years, neighboring pagan nations, especially the Midianites, had invaded Israel at harvesttime with hordes “as numerous as the locusts.” The hand of Midian proved to be so heavy upon them for seven years that the Israelites made underground storage places for themselves in order to conceal their food supplies from the invaders.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 6:1-6</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Called to Serve as a Deliverer.</strong> To avoid discovery by the Midianites, Gideon was threshing <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>grain, not out in the open, but in a winepress, when an angel appeared to him, saying: “Jehovah is with you, you valiant, mighty one.” This prompted Gideon to ask how this could be true, in view of the Midianite oppression of the nation. When told that he would be the one to deliver Israel, Gideon modestly spoke of his own insignificance. But he was assured that Jehovah would prove to be with him. Therefore Gideon asked for a sign so that he might know that the messenger was really Jehovah’s angel. He brought a gift of meat, unfermented cakes, and broth, and at the angel’s direction he placed the items on a big rock and poured out the broth. The angel touched the meat and unfermented cakes with his staff, and fire began to ascend out of the rock and to consume the offering, whereupon the angel vanished.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 6:11-22</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">That very night Jehovah put Gideon to the test by commanding him to tear down his father’s altar to the god Baal, to cut down the sacred pole alongside it, to build an altar to Jehovah, and then to offer his father’s young bull of seven years (evidently a bull that was considered sacred to Baal) upon it, using as firewood the sacred pole. With due caution, Gideon did so at night with the aid of ten servants. When the men of the city got up in the morning and saw what had happened and then learned that Gideon was responsible, they clamored for his life. Joash, though, did not deliver up his son to them but retorted to the effect that Baal should make his own defense. Joash then gave his son Gideon the name Jerubbaal (meaning “Let Baal Make a Legal Defense (Contend)”), saying: “Let Baal make a legal defense in his own behalf, because someone has pulled down his altar.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 6:25-32</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Victory Over Midian.</strong> After this, when the Midianites, together with the Amalekites and the Easterners, again invaded Israel and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel, Jehovah’s spirit enveloped Gideon. Calling together the Abi-ezrites for battle, Gideon sent messengers throughout Manasseh and to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, urging men to join him. Gideon, desiring further evidence that Jehovah was with him, requested that a fleece exposed at night on the threshing floor be wet with dew the next morning but that the floor be dry. When Jehovah granted him this miracle, Gideon cautiously wanted to establish by yet a second sign that Jehovah was with him, and therefore he requested and received a miracle with the circumstances reversed.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 6:33-40</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Thirty-two thousand fighting men rallied around Gideon in response to his call. They encamped at the well of Harod south of the Midianite camp at the hill of Moreh in the low plain. The Israelites’ 32,000 were outnumbered more than four to one by the invaders, who had a force of about 135,000.

At God’s direction, Gideon told those who were afraid and trembling to retire. Twenty-two thousand departed, but still there were too many men. Next, Jehovah instructed Gideon to lead the remaining 10,000 men down to the water to be tested. A few, merely 300, scooped water to the mouth by hand, and these were separated to one side. The others, who bent down upon their knees to drink, were not to be used. The 300, by their method of drinking, manifested alertness, concern for the fight for true worship in Jehovah’s name. By means of this small band of 300, Jehovah promised to save Israel.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 7:1-7</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Gideon with his attendant Purah proceeded to scout the enemy camp at night. There Gideon overheard a man relating a dream to his companion. His companion, in turn, interpreted the dream to mean that Midian and all the camp would be given into Gideon’s hand. Strengthened by what he had heard, Gideon returned to the camp of Israel, organized the 300 into three bands in order to enable him to approach the camp of Midian from three sides, and gave each man a horn and a large jar, inside of which was placed a torch.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 7:9-16</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">With his band of 100, Gideon arrived at the edge of the Midianite camp right after they had posted the sentries for the middle night watch. Then, in keeping with Gideon’s instructions, his men did exactly what he did. The stillness of the night was shattered by the blowing of 300 horns, the smashing of 300 large water jars, and the resounding of 300 war cries; at the same time, the sky was lit up with 300 torches. Confusion seized the enemy camp. The invaders began shouting and fleeing, and “Jehovah proceeded to set the sword of each one against the other in all the camp; and the camp kept up their flight as far as Beth-shittah, on to Zererah, as far as the outskirts of Abel-meholah by Tabbath.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 7:17-22</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In the meantime, the men of Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh were called together to chase <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>after Midian. Moreover, messengers were sent to Ephraim to head off the fleeing Midianites. The Ephraimites followed through, capturing the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan. They also captured and killed the two Midianite princes Oreb and Zeeb. On meeting up with Gideon, though, the Ephraimites “vehemently tried to pick a quarrel with him,” as he had not called them to help at the beginning. However, Gideon, by modestly pointing out that what he had done was nothing in comparison with what they had done in capturing Oreb and Zeeb, calmed their spirit and thereby averted a clash.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 7:23–8:3</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Crossing the Jordan, Gideon and the 300 men with him, though tired, continued pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian, and the men with them. On his way, he requested food from the men of Succoth, but the princes of Succoth refused to lend aid, saying: “Are the palms of Zebah and of Zalmunna already in your hand so that bread has to be given to your army?” The men of Penuel likewise refused to honor Gideon’s request.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 8:4-9</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Arriving at Karkor where the invaders, reduced to about 15,000 men, were encamped, Gideon struck the camp while the enemy was off guard. Zebah and Zalmunna took to flight. Gideon immediately went in pursuit and captured them. Furthermore, “he drove all the camp into trembling.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/11/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 8:10-12</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">While returning from the fight, Gideon captured a young man from Succoth and ascertained from him the names of the princes and older men of the city. In keeping with what he had said earlier when they did not comply with his request for food, Gideon put the older men of Succoth through an experience with thorns and briers. Also, as he had forewarned, Gideon pulled down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of that city for their failure to cooperate in providing food for his men.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 8:13-17</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">After this, Gideon directed his firstborn son Jether to slay Zebah and Zalmunna, as they had killed Gideon’s brothers, the sons of his mother. Being a young man, Jether was afraid to put the Midianite kings to death. Therefore, Gideon, being challenged by Zebah and Zalmunna to do so himself, executed them.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 8:18-21</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>The Ephod Made.</strong> Grateful Israelites asked Gideon to establish his family as a ruling dynasty. However Gideon appreciated that Jehovah was Israel’s rightful King and therefore did not go along with their request. He then suggested that they contribute the gold jewelry they had acquired as spoils of war, the nose rings alone amounting to 1,700 shekels in gold ($218,365). Gideon then made an ephod from the spoils contributed, exhibiting it in Ophrah. But all Israel began to have ‘immoral intercourse’ with the ephod, it even becoming a snare to Gideon and his household. Thus, though his action was doubtless properly motivated, the ephod diverted attention from the true sanctuary assigned by Jehovah​—the tabernacle. Gideon’s efforts miscarried, producing a result contrary to what he had intended.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 8:22-27</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">EPHOD, I</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Dies as an Approved Witness.</strong> So complete was the deliverance Jehovah brought about through Gideon that there was no further disturbance during the 40 years of his judgeship. Gideon came to have many wives, by whom he had 70 sons. After Gideon’s death at a good old age, Israel again fell victim to Baal worship. Furthermore, Abimelech the son of Gideon by his concubine, a woman of Shechem, killed Gideon’s other sons. Only Jotham, the youngest, escaped.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/15/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 8:28–9:5</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ABIMELECH</a> No. 4; <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001685/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OPHRAH</a> No. 3.</p>",

Herod the Great had received the site along with Samaria and other towns as a gift from Caesar Augustus.

(according to some scholars). These projects were named by Herod in honor of Caesar Augustus​—the city was called Caesarea, whereas its seaport was called Sebastos (Greek for Augustus). The city was most beautiful both in material and in construction, and it contained a temple, a theater, and an amphitheater large enough to accommodate a great crowd of people.

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>1.</strong> A city in the territory of Benjamin.

The city is on an elevation, as the name implies.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">During the divided kingdom, Ramah came in for considerable attention, located, as it was, near the border between Israel and Judah and the N-S road of the hill country. King Baasha of Israel began to expand or fortify Ramah in Benjamin while warring against Asa. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003630/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 15:16, 17;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003630/5/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2Ch 16:1</a>) But when the king of Syria attacked Israel from the N, Baasha’s attention was diverted and Asa took Ramah as well as the building materials Baasha had been using there, using these to build up neighboring Geba and Mizpah. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003630/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 15:20-22;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003630/6/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2Ch 16:4-6</a>) It appears that, when Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 B.C.E., the Jews taken captive were assembled in Ramah before being moved to Babylon.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Some scholars have concluded that such an assembling of Jews at Ramah before taking them into exile (perhaps accompanied by the slaughtering of some there) was referred to with the words: “In Ramah a voice is being heard, lamentation and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping over her sons. She has refused to be comforted over her sons, because they are no more.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003630/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jer 31:15</a>) Jacob’s wife Rachel had so desired children as to consider herself “dead” without them.

Or, since Rachel was the mother of Benjamin, Jeremiah’s words may represent her as weeping particularly over the Benjamite inhabitants of Ramah. Jeremiah went on to explain that hope existed, for the exiles would return.

                "<p class=\"sb\">An ancient tradition presented by Eusebius identifies Ramah with the location of modern Rentis (Rantis), in the hills of Ephraim about 35 km (22 mi) NW of Jerusalem. This would be the same place as the Arimathea (Gr. form of Heb. <em>Ra·mahʹ</em>) mentioned in the Christian Greek Scriptures.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003630/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 23:50-53</a>.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">The capital city of the ancient nation of Israel from the year 1070 B.C.E. onward. Following the division of the nation into two kingdoms (997 B.C.E.), Jerusalem continued as the capital of the southern kingdom of Judah. Throughout the Scriptures there are more than 800 references to Jerusalem.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Name.</strong> The earliest recorded name of the city is “Salem.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 14:18</a>) Whereas some try to associate the meaning of the name Jerusalem with that of a West Semitic god named Shalem, the apostle Paul shows that “Peace” is the true meaning of the latter half of the name. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heb 7:2</a>) The Hebrew spelling of this latter half suggests a dual form, hence “Twofold Peace.” In Akkadian (Assyro-Babylonian) texts the city was called Urusalim (or Ur-sa-li-im-mu). On this basis some scholars give the meaning of the name as “City of Peace.” But the Hebrew form, which logically ought to govern, apparently means “Possession (Foundation) of Twofold Peace.”</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Many other expressions and titles were used in the Scriptures to refer to the city. The psalmist on one occasion uses the earlier name, “Salem.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 76:2</a>) Other appellations were: “city of Jehovah” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 60:14</a>), “town of the grand King” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 48:2</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 5:35</a>), “City of Righteousness” and “Faithful Town” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 1:26</a>), “Zion” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 33:20</a>), and “holy city” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ne 11:1;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Isa 48:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 52:1;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Mt 4:5</a>). The name “el Quds,” meaning “the Holy [City],” is still the popular name for it in Arabic. The name shown on present-day maps of Israel is Yerushalayim.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Location.</strong> Comparatively remote from principal international trade routes, Jerusalem lay on the edge of an arid wilderness (the Wilderness of Judah), its water supplies being limited. Nevertheless, two <em>internal</em> trade routes did intersect near the city. One ran in a N-S direction along the top of the plateau forming the “backbone” of ancient Palestine, and this route linked together such cities as Dothan, Shechem, Bethel, Bethlehem, Hebron, and Beer-sheba. The second route ran in an E-W direction from Rabbah (modern ʽAmman), cut through torrent valleys to the Jordan River basin, ascended the steep Judean slopes, and then wound down the western slopes to the Mediterranean Coast and the seaport town of Joppa. Additionally, Jerusalem was centrally located for the whole area of the Promised Land, hence appropriate for a state administration center.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Lying about 55 km (34 mi) inland from the Mediterranean Sea and some 25 km (16 mi) due W of the northern end of the Dead Sea, Jerusalem rests among the hills of the central mountain range. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 125:2</a>.) Its altitude of about 750 m (2,500 ft) above sea level made it one of the highest capital cities in the world at that time. Its “loftiness” is mentioned in the Scriptures, and travelers had to ‘go up’ from the coastal plains to reach the city. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 48:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/10/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 122:3, 4</a>) The climate is pleasant, with cool nights, an average annual temperature of 17° C. (63° F.), and an average annual rainfall of about 63 cm (25 in.), the rain falling mainly between November and April.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Despite its height, Jerusalem does not stand up above the surrounding terrain. The traveler gets a full view of the city only when quite close. To the E, the Mount of Olives rises about 800 m (2,620 ft). North of it, Mount Scopus reaches about 820 m (2,690 ft), and the encircling hills on the S and W rise as high as 835 m (2,740 ft). These elevations give a view of the situation in relation to the Temple Mount (c. 740 m [2,430 ft]).</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In times of war, this situation would seem to constitute a serious disadvantage. Any drawback, however, was compensated for by the city’s being surrounded on three sides by steep-walled valleys: the torrent valley of Kidron on the east and <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>the Valley of Hinnom on the south and west. A central valley, apparently referred to by Josephus as the Tyropoeon Valley (or “the Valley of the Cheesemakers”), bisected the city area into eastern and western hills or spurs. (<em>The Jewish War,</em> V, 136, 140 [iv, 1]) This central valley has filled in considerably throughout the centuries, but a visitor still must make a rather sharp descent to a central hollow and then climb up the other side when crossing the city. There is evidence that, in addition to the N-S central valley, two smaller E-W valleys, or depressions, further divided the hills, one cutting across the eastern hill and the other across the western.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The steep valley walls seem to have been incorporated into the city’s defensive wall system in all periods. The only side of the city lacking in natural defense was that on the N, and here the walls were made especially strong. When attacking the city in 70 C.E., General Titus, according to Josephus, was faced with three successive walls on that side.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Water Supply.</strong> Jerusalem’s inhabitants suffered from serious food shortages in siege, but evidently had no great water problem. For, in spite of its nearness to the arid Judean Wilderness, the city had access to a constant supply of fresh water and had adequate storage facilities within the city walls.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Two springs, En-rogel and Gihon, were located near the city. The first lay a little S of the junction of the Kidron and Hinnom valleys. While a valuable source of water, its position made it inaccessible during times of attack or siege. The Gihon spring lay on the W side of the Kidron Valley, alongside what came to be called the City of David. Though outside the city walls, it was close enough that a tunnel could be excavated connecting to a shaft, enabling the city’s inhabitants to draw water without going outside the protective walls. This was done early in the city’s history, according to the archaeological evidence. In 1961 and 1962, excavations revealed a substantial early wall, situated <em>below</em> the upper end, or entrance, of the tunnel, hence enclosing it. It is thought to be the wall of the old Jebusite city.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Over the years, additional tunnels and canals were formed to channel Gihon’s waters. One channel ran from the mouth of the cave of the Gihon spring down the valley and around the end of the SE hill to a pool located at the junction of the Hinnom Valley with the central or Tyropoeon Valley. According to what has been found, it was in the form of a trench, covered with flat stones, and tunneled through the hillside at points. Openings at intervals allowed for water to be drawn off for irrigation of the valley terraces below. The canal’s gradient of about 4 or 5 millimeters per meter (less than 0.2 in. per yd) produced a slow gentle flow, reminding one of “the waters of the Shiloah that are going gently.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/11/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 8:6</a>) It is suggested that this canal, unprotected and vulnerable, was constructed during Solomon’s reign, when peace and security were predominant.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jerusalem’s homes and buildings were evidently equipped with underground cisterns, supplementing the supply of water from springs. Rainwater collected from the roofs was stored therein, kept clean and cool. The temple area seems to have had particularly large cisterns, archaeologists claiming to have plotted 37 cisterns there with a total capacity of about 38,000 kl (10,000,000 gal), one cistern alone estimated as capable of holding 7,600 kl (2,000,000 gal).</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Over the centuries a number of aqueducts, or conduits, were built, in order to provide water for Jerusalem. Tradition ascribes to Solomon the construction of a conduit from the “Pools of Solomon” (three reservoirs SW of Bethlehem) to the temple enclosure at Jerusalem. At <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ecclesiastes 2:6</a>, Solomon says: “I made pools of water for myself, to irrigate with them the forest.” Such a large undertaking as the building of the pools could well have included the building of a conduit for the larger supply of water that would be needed at Jerusalem after the temple services were instituted. However, there is no evidence, other than tradition, to support the Solomonic origin of a conduit from the Pools of Solomon to Jerusalem. A number of aqueducts can still be traced. One conduit constructed to carry water from springs in the Wadi el-ʽArrub 20 km (12 mi) SSW of Jerusalem to the Pools of Solomon is possibly the one alluded to by Josephus, who says that it was constructed by Pontius Pilate with temple treasury funds. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XVIII, 60 [iii, 2]; <em>The Jewish War,</em> II, 175 [ix, 4]) Of the two aqueducts leading from the Pools of Solomon to Jerusalem, the lower one is the older, possibly dating from the time of Herod or of the Hasmonaeans. This aqueduct passed under the village of Bethlehem and ran on to the Temple Mount over “Wilson’s Arch.”</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Archaeological Research.</strong> Though much research and excavation have been carried out, few concrete facts have been determined as to the city of Bible times. Various factors have restricted investigation or limited its value. Jerusalem has had almost continuous occupation in the Common Era, thus severely reducing the area available for excavation. <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>Then, too, the city was destroyed a number of times, with new cities built on top of the ruins and often made, in part, from material of those ruins. The piling up of debris and rubble, in some places about 30 m (100 ft) deep, has obscured the early contours of the site and made the interpretation of the excavated evidence a precarious task. Some wall sections, pools, water tunnels, and ancient tombs have been unearthed, but very little written material. Principal archaeological discoveries have come from the SE hill, which now lies outside the city walls.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The main sources of information regarding the ancient city, therefore, remain the Bible and the description of the first-century city given by Jewish historian Josephus.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Early History.</strong> The first historical mention of the city comes in the decade between 1943 and 1933 B.C.E., when Abraham’s encounter with Melchizedek took place. Melchizedek was “king of Salem” and “priest of the Most High God.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 14:17-20</a>) However, the origins of the city and of the population that composed it are as wrapped in obscurity as is the origin of its king-priest Melchizedek.​—Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heb 7:1-3</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Apparently another event in Abraham’s life involved the vicinity of Jerusalem. Abraham was commanded to offer up his son Isaac on “one of the mountains” in “the land of Moriah.” The temple built by Solomon was erected on “Mount Moriah” on a site that previously had been a threshing floor. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/15/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 22:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/15/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2Ch 3:1</a>) Thus, the Bible apparently links the place of Abraham’s attempted sacrifice with the mountainous region around Jerusalem. (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MORIAH</a>.) Whether Melchizedek was still living then is not revealed; but Salem likely remained friendly territory for Abraham.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The Amarna Tablets, written by Canaanite rulers to their Egyptian overlord, include seven letters from the king or governor of Jerusalem (Urusalim). These letters were written prior to the Israelite conquest of Canaan. Thus, Jerusalem, in the approximately 465-year period between Abraham’s meeting with Melchizedek and the Israelite conquest, had become the possession of pagan Hamitic Canaanites and was under the domination of the Hamitic Egyptian Empire.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The account of Joshua’s sweeping conquest of Canaan lists Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, among the confederate kings attacking Gibeon. His name (meaning “(My) Lord Is Righteousness”) closely parallels that of Jerusalem’s earlier King Melchizedek (“King of Righteousness”), but Adoni-zedek was no worshiper of the Most High God, Jehovah.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 10:1-5,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 23,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 26;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12:7, 8,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 10</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In the allotting of tribal territories, Jerusalem was on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin, the specific border running along the Valley of Hinnom. This would place at least what comprised the later “City of David,” situated on the ridge between the Kidron and Tyropoeon valleys, within the territory of Benjamin. Apparently the Canaanite city had additional settlements, or “suburbs,” however, and part of the settled area may have overlapped into Judah’s territory to the W and S of the Valley of Hinnom. Judah is credited with the initial capture of Jerusalem at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Judges 1:8</a>, but after the invading forces moved on, the Jebusite inhabitants apparently remained (or returned) in sufficient force to form a later pocket of resistance that neither Judah nor Benjamin could break. Thus, of both Judah and Benjamin it is said that the ‘Jebusites continued dwelling with them in Jerusalem.’ (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/18/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 15:63;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/18/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Jg 1:21</a>) This situation continued for some four centuries, and the city was at times referred to as “Jebus,” “a city of foreigners.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 19:10-12;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/19/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1Ch 11:4, 5</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>During the United Kingdom.</strong> King Saul’s headquarters were at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin. King David’s capital city was first at Hebron in Judah, about 30 km (19 mi) SSW of Jerusalem.

                "<p class=\"sb\">It seems that the Jebusites at that time had their city on the southern end of the eastern spur. They were confident of the impregnability of their fortress city, with its natural defenses of steep valley walls on three sides and, probably, special fortifications on the north. It was known as “the place difficult to approach” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/24/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ch 11:7</a>), and the Jebusites taunted David that even ‘the blind and the lame of the city’ could hold off his attacks. But David conquered the city, his attack being spearheaded by Joab, who evidently gained entry into the city by means of “the water tunnel.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/25/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:6-9;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/25/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1Ch 11:4-8</a>) Scholars are not entirely certain of the meaning of the Hebrew term here rendered “water tunnel,” but generally accept this or similar terms (“water shaft,” <em>RS, AT;</em> “gutter,” <em>JP</em>) as the most likely meaning. The brief account does not state just how the city’s defenses were breached. Since the discovery of the tunnel and shaft leading to the Gihon spring, the popular view is that Joab led men up this vertical shaft, through the sloping tunnel and into the city in a surprise attack. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 951) By whatever means, the city was taken and David <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>moved his capital there (1070 B.C.E.). The Jebusite stronghold now came to be known as “the City of David,” also called “Zion.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/26/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:7</a>.</p>",

When David later transferred the sacred “ark of Jehovah” from the house of Obed-edom to Jerusalem, the city became the religious, as well as administrative, center of the nation.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/30/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 6:11, 12,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/30/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 17</a>; see <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BURIAL, BURIAL PLACES</a>; <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DAVID, CITY OF</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MOUND</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">There is no record of Jerusalem’s being attacked by enemy forces during David’s reign, as he carried the battle to his foes.

On one occasion, however, David saw fit to abandon the city before the advance of rebel forces led by his own son, Absalom. The king’s retreat may have been to avoid having blood shed in civil war at this place where Jehovah’s name rested. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/32/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 15:13-17</a>) Whatever the motive for the retreat, it led to the fulfillment of the inspired prophecy spoken by Nathan.

Another son, Adonijah, was at the spring of En-rogel, plotting to seize the kingship, when Solomon was anointed at the spring of Gihon. The distance between the two points was short enough (c. 700 m; 2,300 ft) that Adonijah and his coconspirators heard the noise of the horn and celebrations at Gihon.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/38/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 1:5-9,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/38/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 32-41</a>.</p>",

Then, in the year 168 B.C.E., Syrian King Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), in his attempt to Hellenize completely the Jews, dedicated Jerusalem’s temple to Zeus (Jupiter) and profaned the altar by an unclean sacrifice.

About 142 B.C.E., Simon Maccabaeus was able to make Jerusalem the capital of a region ostensibly free from subservience to or taxation by Gentile nations. Aristobulus I, Jerusalem’s high priest, even assumed the title of king in 104 B.C.E. He was not, however, of the Davidic line.</p>",

Under General Pompey, Roman forces besieged Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. for three months in order to enter the city and settle the dispute. Twelve thousand Jews reportedly died, many at the hands of fellow Israelites.</p>",

Another fortress, the Tower of Antonia, lay near the temple and was connected with it by a passageway. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 535; <em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XV, 424 [xi, 7]) The Roman garrison could thus gain quick access to the temple area, as likely occurred when soldiers rescued Paul from a mob there.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/89/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ac 21:31, 32</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Herod’s greatest work, however, was the reconstruction of the temple and its building complex. Beginning in his 18th year (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XV, 380 [xi, 1]), the holy house itself was completed in a year and a half, but the work on the adjoining buildings and courtyards went on long after his death.

Part of the wall of the temple courtyard apparently still stands, known today as the Western Wall, or the Wailing Wall. Archaeologists date the lower courses of huge 0.9-m-high (3 ft) blocks as from Herod’s construction.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>From 2 B.C.E. to 70 C.E.</strong> The Christian Greek Scriptures now carry forward the description of events involving Jerusalem. Jesus’ birth took place, not at Jerusalem, but at nearby Bethlehem, “David’s city.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/91/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 2:10, 11</a>) Nevertheless, the astrologers’ later report about the birth of the “king of the Jews” caused Herod and “all Jerusalem along with him” to become agitated. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/92/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 2:1-3</a>) Shortly after issuing his infamous decree ordering the killing of Bethlehem’s babes, Herod died, evidently in the year 1 B.C.E. (See <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/11\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HEROD</a> No. 1.) His son Archelaus inherited rulership over Jerusalem and Judea as well as other areas.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Jesus was taken to Jerusalem 40 days after birth and presented at the temple as Mary’s firstborn.

How many other times he was taken to Jerusalem during his childhood years is not stated, only one visit, made when he was 12, being specifically recorded.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Six days prior to the Passover festival of 33 C.E., Jesus came to Bethany, on the eastern side of the Mount of Olives.

The witnessing done by the spirit-filled Christians resulted in thousands becoming baptized disciples. With thousands bearing witness to their faith, it is no wonder the angry religious leaders cried: “Look! you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/118/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ac 5:28</a>) Miracles performed added power to the testimony, as, for example, the healing of the lame beggar at “the temple door that was called Beautiful,” likely the E gate of the Court of Women.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/119/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ac 3:2,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/119/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 6, 7</a>.</p>",

Suddenly Cestius Gallus withdrew for no apparent reason. This allowed Christians to put into action Jesus’ instructions: “Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains, and let those in the midst of [Jerusalem] withdraw, and let those in the country places not enter into her.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/130/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 21:20-22</a>) Eusebius, in his <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> (III, V, 3), states that the Christians fled from Jerusalem and the whole land of Judea to a city of Perea that was called Pella.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jerusalem’s relief as a result of the Roman withdrawal was short-lived, as it had been when the Babylonians temporarily withdrew to deal with the Egyptians near the end of King Zedekiah’s reign. Under General Titus the Roman forces returned in 70 C.E. in increased numbers and laid siege to the city, now crowded with Passover celebrants. Siege banks were thrown up by the Romans, and a continuous wall or fence was erected around the entire city to prevent escape by day or night. This, too, fulfilled Jesus’ prophecy.

His account also states that the repository of the archives, housing the genealogical records of tribal and family descent and inheritance rights, was put to the fire.

The unreasoning attitude and actions of the Jews within the city doubtless <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>contributed to this shortness. Though Josephus puts the number of dead at 1,100,000, there were survivors. Ninety-seven thousand captives were taken, many of whom were sent as slaves to Egypt or were killed by sword or beasts in the theaters of the Roman provinces.

                "<p class=\"sb\">The entire city was demolished, with only the towers of Herod’s palace and a portion of the western wall left standing as evidence to later generations of the defensive strength that had availed nothing. Josephus remarks that, apart from these remnants, “the rest of the wall encompassing the city was so completely levelled to the ground as to leave future visitors to the spot no ground for believing that it had ever been inhabited.” (<em>The Jewish War,</em> VII, 3 [i, 1]) A relief on the Arch of Titus in Rome depicts Roman soldiers carrying off sacred vessels of the ruined temple.​—Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/134/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 24:2</a>; PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 752.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Later Periods.</strong> Jerusalem remained virtually desolate until about 130 C.E., when Emperor Hadrian ordered the building of a new city, named Aelia Capitolina. This provoked a Jewish revolt by Bar Kokhba (132-135 C.E.), which succeeded for a time but was then crushed. Jews were not allowed in the Roman-built city for nearly two centuries. In the fourth century, Constantine the Great’s mother Helena visited Jerusalem and began the identification of the many so-called holy sites and shrines. Later the Muslims captured the city. Today there are two Islamic structures on the Temple Mount. Late in the seventh century Caliph ʽAbd al-Malik ibn Marwan built the Dome of the Rock on or near the temple site. Although also called a mosque, it is in reality a shrine. South of the Dome of the Rock is the el-Aqsa mosque, first constructed in the eighth century, but largely rebuilt in the eleventh century.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">Professor John Garstang, leader of an English expedition at Tell es-Sultan between 1929 and 1936, found that what he considered to be one of the cities built on the site had been subjected to intense fires and its walls had fallen. This city he identified with the Jericho of Joshua’s time and assigned its destruction to about 1400 B.C.E. Although some scholars today still endorse Garstang’s conclusions, others interpret the evidence differently. Writes archaeologist G. Ernest Wright: “The two walls which surrounded the summit of the old city, which Garstang . . . believed were destroyed by earthquake and fire in Joshua’s time, were discovered to date from the 3rd millennium and to represent only two of some fourteen different walls or wall-components built successively during that age.” (<em>Biblical Archaeology,</em> 1962, pp. 79, 80) Many feel that little, if anything, remains of the Jericho that existed in Joshua’s time, earlier excavations at the site having removed what might have survived from the time of its destruction. As Professor Jack Finegan notes: “There is now, therefore, virtually no evidence at the site by which to try to determine at what date Joshua might have taken Jericho.”​—<em>Light From the Ancient Past,</em> 1959, p. 159.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">For this reason numerous scholars date the fall of Jericho on circumstantial evidence, and suggested dates span a period of about 200 years. In view of such uncertainty, Professor Merrill F. Unger fittingly observes: “Scholars also must be extremely wary of attaching undue authority to archeologists’ estimates of dates and interpretation of data. That the fixing of dates and the conclusions drawn from archeological findings often depend on subjective factors is amply demonstrated by the wide divergences between competent authorities on these matters.”​—<em>Archaeology and the Old Testament,</em> 1964, p. 164.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Therefore, the fact that the interpretations of archaeologists do not agree with Biblical chronology in pointing to 1473 B.C.E. as the date for Jericho’s destruction is no reason for concern. The difference in the viewpoint of Garstang and other archaeologists about Jericho illustrates the need for caution in accepting archaeological testimony regardless of whether it seems to confirm or to contradict the Bible record and its chronology.</p>",

In the latter half of the fourth century B.C.E., Alexander the Great, after a five-month siege (two months, according to <em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XI, 325 [viii, 4]), took Gaza. Many of its inhabitants were slain and the survivors were sold into slavery. Over 200 years later, the Jew Alexander Jannaeus, after a year’s siege, completely devastated the city.​—<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XIII, 364 (xiii, 3).</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">A league or confederation of ten cities (from Greek <em>deʹka,</em> meaning “ten,” and <em>poʹlis,</em> “city”). The name also applied to the region in which most of these cities were centered.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 4:25</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Following the conquest by Alexander the Great in about 332 B.C.E., Greek colonies developed in Syria and Palestine, apparently settled by veterans from Alexander’s armies who were thereafter followed by Greek-speaking immigrants. In many cases these colonies grew on the sites of earlier Jewish towns, while in others they were built on fresh sites, particularly E of the Jordan River. They flourished during the rule of the Seleucids of Syria and the Ptolemies of Egypt, but the rise of the Maccabean-Jewish state (starting c. 168 B.C.E.) greatly jeopardized their relatively independent position. While the populations of these cities doubtless included many Jews, still these cities were centers of Greek culture and organization and hence were very much out of step with the Maccabean aims. When Pompey conquered and reorganized Palestine in 63 B.C.E., these Hellenistic cities were given Roman protection and a favored status. They were allowed to mint their own coins and, to a great extent, to exercise self-government, although they still owed allegiance to Rome and to the Syrian provincial government and were required to pay taxes and provide men for military service.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Formation of the League.</strong> Likely sometime between Pompey’s conquest and the death of Herod the Great (c. 1 B.C.E.) ten of these Hellenistic cities formed themselves into the loose federation known as the Decapolis. The motive underlying this union seems to have been a mutual interest in close trade relations and also defense against either anti-Hellenistic forces within Palestine or aggressive nomadic tribes in the desert regions to the E. The term “Decapolis” first appears in the Christian Greek Scriptures and in the writings of Josephus and Pliny the Elder (both of the first century C.E.). Pliny, while acknowledging that some difference of opinion already existed, listed the following cities as among the original ten: Damascus, Philadelphia, Raphana, Scythopolis, Gadara, Hippo (Hippos), Dion, Pella, Galasa <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>(Gerasa), and Canatha. (<em>Natural History,</em> V, XVI, 74) Of these, only Scythopolis (Beth-shean) lay W of the Jordan; because of the strategic position of the Valley of Esdraelon (Jezreel), it served as an important link with the Mediterranean Coast and seaports. Damascus, far to the N in Syria, was evidently included because of its importance as a trade center. Philadelphia (ancient Rabbah, modern ʽAmman) was the southernmost of the ten cities, only about 40 km (25 mi) NE of the northern end of the Dead Sea. The remainder of the cities were in the fertile region of Gilead or neighboring Bashan. Most of them are believed to have been on or near the main roads of that region. Canatha is likely the Kenath of <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Numbers 32:42</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In the second century C.E., Ptolemy names 18 cities as in the “Decapolis,” which may indicate that the name came to be used in a general way and that the number of cities varied. Some scholars would put Abila, listed by Ptolemy, in place of Raphana as among the original ten. It seems evident, at any rate, that the Decapolis region did not have precisely defined boundaries and that the authority of the cities of the Decapolis did not embrace all the intervening territory but applied only within the district of each particular city.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Jesus’ Ministry and the Decapolis.</strong> While people from the Decapolis were among the crowds that flocked to hear Jesus’ teaching in Galilee (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 4:25</a>), there is no specific mention of his having devoted time to any of its Hellenistic cities. Jesus did enter the region of Decapolis during his Galilean ministry when he crossed the Sea of Galilee and entered the country of the Gerasenes (or Gadarenes according to <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 8:28</a>).

                "<p class=\"sb\">After the Passover of 32 C.E., and upon returning from a trip to the regions of Tyre and Sidon in Phoenicia, Jesus came “to the sea of Galilee up through the midst of the regions of Decapolis.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mr 7:31</a>) Somewhere in this region he healed a deaf man having a speech impediment and later miraculously fed a crowd of 4,000.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mr 7:32–8:9</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Later History.</strong> According to Eusebius, prior to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E., Christians of Judea fled to the Decapolitan city of Pella in the mountainous region of Gilead, thereby giving heed to Jesus’ prophetic warning.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 21:20, 21</a>; <em>The Ecclesiastical History,</em> III, V, 3.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">By no means alone among the cities of Palestine in their Hellenistic leanings, the cities of the Decapolis reflected the most powerful expression of Greek influence. They are believed to have reached their peak during the second century C.E., and in the following century the league began to break up. Evidence of the strong Greek influence, as well as the wealth of the Decapolitan cities, can be seen in the impressive remains of theaters, amphitheaters, temples, baths, aqueducts, and other structures at Gerasa (modern Jarash) as well as at other cities.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">It was not necessary for Adam to be a spirit creature, in whole or in part, to possess Godlike qualities. Jehovah formed man out of the dust particles of the ground, put in him the force of life so that he became a living soul, and gave him the ability to reflect the image and likeness of his Creator. “The first man is out of the earth and made of dust.” “The first man Adam became a living soul.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 2:7;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/3/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1Co 15:45,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/3/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 47</a>) That was in the year 4026 B.C.E.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Adam’s home was a very special paradise, a veritable garden of pleasure called Eden (see <a class=\"it\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">EDEN</a> No. 1), providing him with all the necessary physical things of life, for “every tree desirable to one’s sight and good for food” for his perpetual sustenance was there.

But Adam was alone. There was no other creature ‘according to his kind’ with which to talk. Jehovah recognized that “it is not good for the man to continue by himself.” So by divine surgery, the first and only case of its kind, Jehovah took a rib from Adam and fashioned it into a female counterpart to be his wife and the mother of his children. Overjoyed with such a beautiful helper and constant companion, Adam burst forth in the first recorded poetry, “This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh,” and she was called <em>woman</em> “because from man this one was taken.” Later Adam called his wife Eve. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 2:18-23;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/5/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 3:20</a>) The truthfulness of this account is attested to by Jesus and the apostles.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 19:4-6;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/6/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Mr 10:6-9;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/6/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Eph 5:31;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/6/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1Ti 2:13</a>.</p>",

They were not cursed with idleness. They were to keep busy and active dressing and taking care of their garden home, and as they multiplied and filled the earth with billions of their kind, they were to expand this Paradise to earth’s limits. This was a divine mandate.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 1:28</a>.</p>",

He was equipped with the power of speech and with a highly developed vocabulary. He was able to give meaningful names to the living creatures all around him. He was capable of carrying on a two-way conversation with his God and with his wife.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">For all these reasons and many more, Adam was under obligation to love, worship, and strictly obey his Grand Creator. More than that, the Universal Lawgiver spelled out for him the simple law of obedience and fully informed him of the just and reasonable penalty for disobedience: “As for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 2:16, 17;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/10/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 3:2, 3</a>) Notwithstanding this explicit law carrying a severe penalty for disobedience, he did disobey.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Results of Sin.</strong> Eve was thoroughly deceived by Satan the Devil, but “Adam was not deceived,” says the apostle Paul.

When brought to trial, instead of showing sorrow or regret or asking for forgiveness, Adam attempted to justify himself and pass the responsibility off on others, even blaming Jehovah for his own willful sin. “The woman whom <em>you</em> gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree and so I ate.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 3:7-12</a>) So Adam was cast out of Eden into an unsubdued earth that was cursed to produce thorns and thistles, there to sweat out an existence, harvesting the bitter fruits of his sin. Outside the garden, awaiting death, Adam fathered sons and daughters, the names of only three being preserved​—Cain, Abel, and Seth. To all of his children Adam passed on hereditary sin and death, since he himself was sinful.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 3:23;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/13/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 4:1, 2,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/13/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 25</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">This was the tragic start Adam gave the human race. Paradise, happiness, and everlasting life were forfeited, and in their place sin, suffering, and death were acquired through disobedience. “Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” “Death ruled as king from Adam down.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ro 5:12,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/14/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 14</a>) But Jehovah in his wisdom and love provided a “second man,” “the last Adam,” who is the Lord Jesus Christ. By means of this obedient “Son of God” the way was opened up whereby descendants of the <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>disobedient “first man Adam” could regain Paradise and everlasting life, the church or congregation of Christ even gaining heavenly life. “For just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ all will be made alive.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/15/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 3:16,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/15/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 18;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/15/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Ro 6:23;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/15/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1Co 15:22,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/15/4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 45,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/15/5\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 47</a>.</p>",

He watched and was condemned by the example of Enoch, “the seventh one in line from Adam,” one who “kept walking with the true God.” He even lived to see Noah’s father Lamech of the ninth generation.

                "<p class=\"sb\">The Bible record indicates that the damming up of the Jordan’s waters at the time of Israel’s crossing the river took place at Adam. The Jordan Valley narrows considerably, beginning at the site of Tell ed-Damiyeh (Tel Damiya’) northward, and history records that in the year 1267 a blockage of the river occurred at this very point due to the falling of a lofty mound across the river, stopping the flow of water for some 16 hours. In modern times, earth tremors in the summer of 1927 again caused landslides that dammed up the Jordan so that the flow of water was cut off for 21 1⁄2 hours. (<em>The Foundations of Bible History: Joshua, Judges,</em> by J. Garstang, London, 1931, pp. 136, 137) If this was the means God saw fit to employ, then such a damming of the river in the days of Joshua was miraculously timed and effected so as to synchronize with the crossing of the Jordan on the day previously announced by Jehovah through Joshua.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000089/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 3:5-13</a>.</p>"

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>1.</strong> A prominent city of Israel, more frequently mentioned in the Bible than any other except Jerusalem. It is identified with the ruins by the modern village of Beitin, about 17 km (11 mi) N of Jerusalem. It thus lay on a rocky ridge in the extreme southern part of the mountainous region of Ephraim at about 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level. The surrounding area today is quite barren, consisting of a stony plateau with sparse vegetation. Yet the existence of several springs there shows that the ancient city had an excellent water supply.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Bethel’s position was strategic and contributed greatly to its importance. Situated on the backbone of the central mountain range, it was on the important N-S route that followed the watershed line, running all the way from Shechem southward through Bethel, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron, and down to Beer-sheba. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 21:19</a>.) Another route connected Bethel with Joppa to the W on the Mediterranean and with Jericho to the E near the Jordan. Bethel was thus a crossroads town, as were Samaria, Jerusalem, Hebron, and Beer-sheba. Additionally, the evidence indicates that the area between Jerusalem and Bethel was a region of dense population, having a greater concentration of towns than any other part of Palestine.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Archaeological excavations at Beitin reveal it to be a site of great antiquity, the suggestion being given that the original settlement dated back to about the 21st century B.C.E. Evidence was also found of a severe destruction and conflagration leaving debris and ashes 1.5 m (c. 5 ft) deep in some places, and this is believed likely to have occurred during the conquest of Canaan by Israel.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Upon Abraham’s entry into Canaan, he stopped at Shechem and then moved S “to the mountainous region to the east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 12:8</a>) After spending some time in Egypt because of a famine in Canaan, Abraham again settled to the E of Bethel, in company with his nephew Lot. Since in both cases Abraham pitched tent to the E of Bethel, it is suggested that the site of his encampment was at Burj Beitin, a short distance SE of Beitin, which has been called “one of the great view-points of Palestine.” (<em>Encyclopædia Biblica,</em> edited by T. K. Cheyne, London, 1899, Vol. I, col. 552) It may have been from such a vantage point that Abraham invited Lot to select the direction in which he would go upon separating from Abraham, with the result that Lot “raised his eyes and saw the whole District of the Jordan” and decided in favor of that region. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 13:8-11</a>) Jehovah thereafter invited Abraham to view the land in all directions, assuring him that it would be for an inheritance to him and his seed.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 13:14, 15</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Although Moses, in compiling the Genesis account, speaks of the town near which Abraham camped as “Bethel,” the subsequent record shows its original Canaanite name to have been “Luz.” (See <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LUZ</a> No. 1.) Jacob spent the night near the city when traveling from Beer-sheba to Haran, and after having a dream of a ladder reaching to the heavens and hearing God’s confirmation of the Abrahamic promise, he thereafter set up a pillar and called the name of the place Bethel, although “Luz was the city’s name formerly.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 28:10-19</a>) Some 20 years later God spoke to Jacob at Haran, identifying himself as the one who had addressed Jacob at Bethel, and instructed him to return to Canaan.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 31:13</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Following the defilement of Dinah at Shechem and the act of vengeance executed by Jacob’s sons against the Shechemites, Jacob received God’s instruction to return to Bethel. After eliminating false religious articles from his household and servants, he traveled to Bethel under divine protection, built an altar there, and restated the name he had given the place earlier, calling it El-bethel, meaning “The God of Bethel.” Here Rebekah’s nursing woman Deborah died and was buried. Here, too, Jehovah confirmed the change of Jacob’s name to Israel, restating the Abrahamic promise.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 35:1-16</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Centuries later, upon the entry of the nation of Israel into Canaan (1473 B.C.E.), the name Bethel is again used to refer to the city previously called <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>Luz rather than to the camping site of Abraham and Jacob. In the account of the attack upon Ai, the record indicates that the Canaanite men of Bethel endeavored to support the men of that neighboring city, but to no avail. If not at that point, then at a later time Bethel’s king met defeat by Joshua’s forces.

It is listed as assigned to Benjamin, but the record shows that it was the house of Joseph (of which Ephraim was a part) that effected the conquest of the city.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Bethel was on the circuit visited by Samuel as he judged the people annually at that city as well as at Gilgal and Mizpah, and it was still viewed as a place favored for worship.

                "<p class=\"sb\">As a major city of the northern kingdom under Jeroboam, Bethel, once prominent as a place of revelation by the true God, now became renowned as a center of false worship. At Bethel, in the extreme S of the newly formed kingdom of Israel, and at Dan, in the extreme N thereof, Jeroboam set up the golden calves in his effort to dissuade the people of his realm from going to the temple at Jerusalem. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 12:27-29</a>) With its own religious house and altar, a specially invented festival time, and priests selected from among the non-Levitical tribes, Bethel became a symbol of rank apostasy from true worship. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 12:31-33</a>) Jehovah God did not delay in expressing his disapproval through a “man of the true God” sent to Bethel to pronounce judgment against the altar used in connection with calf worship. The ripping apart of this altar served as a portent, confirming the sure fulfillment of the prophet’s words.

Slain by a lion, he was buried at Bethel in the personal burial place of the old prophet who saw in all these events the certainty of the fulfillment of Jehovah’s word and thus requested that his own body be buried at death in the same burial site.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/15/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 13:1-32</a>.</p>",

There are also two other springs in the vicinity, ʽAin el-Qudeirat and ʽAin el-Qeseimeh.

Consequently, the identification of ʽAin Qedeis with Kadesh-barnea seems to be more in line with the description of the E-W course of Canaan’s southern boundary: Kadesh-barnea (ʽAin Qedeis?), Hazar-addar (ʽAin el-Qudeirat?), and Azmon (ʽAin el-Qeseimeh?).​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002564/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nu 34:3-5</a>.</p>",

So, for them to have used all three springs is not an unreasonable possibility.

Generally, the ancient city is linked with modern Gaza (Ghazzeh; ʽAzza), located about 80 km (50 mi) WSW of Jerusalem. Although separated from the Mediterranean Sea by about 5 km (3 mi) of rolling sand dunes, Gaza lies in a well-watered region known for its olive groves, fruit and sycamore trees, grapevines, and grain. Agriculture likely contributed to the prosperity of ancient Gaza. But its importance stemmed primarily from its location on the main road linking Egypt with Palestine. This made Gaza a “gateway” both for caravans and military traffic.</p>",

The exact location of the mountain facing Hebron is uncertain. For Samson to carry the gates and sideposts any distance, and up a mountain at that, was clearly a manifestation of miraculous power made possible only by Jehovah’s spirit.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Under Assyrian and Babylonian Rule.</strong> Toward the close of the ninth century B.C.E., through his prophet Amos, Jehovah stated that he would send “a fire” onto the walls of Gaza, this in retribution for its taking exiles to hand over to the Edomites.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Not long thereafter, about the middle of the eighth century B.C.E., Gaza began to experience the “fire” of war. According to Assyrian annals, Tiglath-pileser III conquered Gaza, but its king, Hanno, fled to Egypt. (<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> edited by J. Pritchard, 1974, p. 283) Apparently Hanno was soon able to return to Gaza, for Sargon II claims to have defeated both him and the Egyptian army under Sibʼe allied with him. Sargon II claims to have personally captured Hanno and taken him away in fetters.​—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 285.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">From this time onward, Gaza appears to have been generally loyal to Assyria. Hence, it may be that King Hezekiah’s striking down the Philistines as far as Gaza was a phase of his revolt against Assyria.

                "<p class=\"sb\">In the time of Jeremiah, Egypt’s army struck down Gaza.

As suggested by other passages in <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001622/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremiah (1:14;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001622/17/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 46:20</a>), the “waters” from “the north” mentioned at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001622/18/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremiah 47:2</a> evidently denote the Babylonian armies. King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon did, in fact, gain control over this area (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001622/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ki 24:1,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001622/19/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 7</a>), and the king of Gaza is mentioned in Babylonian inscriptions. (<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 308) Consequently, the words “before Pharaoh proceeded to strike down Gaza” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001622/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jer 47:1</a>) appear simply to identify the time when the utterance of Jehovah regarding the Philistines came to Jeremiah. They would not necessarily be directly related to the coming expression of judgment “from the north” thereafter discussed.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Destroyed.</strong> The prophet Zephaniah, a contemporary of Jeremiah, sounded a like judgment from Jehovah for Gaza: “An abandoned city is what she will become.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001622/21/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zep 2:4</a>) And Zechariah’s prophecy, recorded after Babylon’s fall, pointed to future calamities: “[Gaza] will also feel very severe pains.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001622/22/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zec 9:5</a>) History confirms the fulfillment of the foretold calamities. In the latter half of the fourth century B.C.E., Alexander the Great, after a five-month siege (two months, according to <em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XI, 325 [viii, 4]), took Gaza. Many of its inhabitants were slain and the survivors were sold into slavery. Over 200 years later, the Jew Alexander Jannaeus, after a year’s siege, completely devastated the city.​—<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XIII, 364 (xiii, 3).</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Although the Roman governor of Syria, Gabinius, ordered the rebuilding of Gaza, this was likely done on a new site. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XIV, 87, 88 [v, 3]) Some scholars think that at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001622/23/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Acts 8:26</a> the Greek word <em>eʹre·mos</em> (desolate [place]) refers to the old, abandoned Gaza (<em>AT,</em> for example, reads: “The town is now deserted”). Others understand <em>eʹre·mos</em> to refer to the road leading to the city, hence the rendering “this is a desert road.”​—<em>NW;</em> compare <em>JB, NE, RS.</em></p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>2.</strong> A city with dependent towns located in Ephraim’s territory.

Gaza may be a site in the vicinity of ancient Ai, if not perhaps identical with that city itself. The reading “Ayyah” found in numerous Bible translations has the support of many Hebrew manuscripts. However, there is also evidence for “Gaza” in other Hebrew manuscripts, as well as in the Targums.</p>"

Only its lower slopes sustain such vegetation as vines and olive trees, the higher elevations being quite barren and rocky. Like other mountains in Samaria, Ebal consists of a limestone core with an outer shell of chalk. It stands to the NE of Mount Gerizim and rises to a peak of over 900 m (3,000 ft) above the level of the Mediterranean.

An altar was to be erected there, upon which sacrifices were to be presented to Jehovah. Moses also said, “You must write on the stones all the words of this law, making them quite clear.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001245/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 27:1-8</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">After Israel crossed the Jordan, the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali were to “stand for the malediction on Mount Ebal,” and the other tribes were to “stand to bless the people on Mount Gerizim.” At that time the blessings to be enjoyed by those obeying God’s law, as well as the curses or maledictions to be experienced by those breaking his law, would be recited.

                "<p class=\"sb\">After Israel’s victory at Ai, Joshua complied with Moses’ instructions, building an altar to Jehovah in Mount Ebal. Upon stones (perhaps, but not necessarily, those of the altar itself) he wrote “a copy of the law of Moses that he had written before the sons of Israel.” Then, in front of the congregation of Israel (including the alien residents) assembled as Moses had directed, Joshua “read aloud all the words of the law, the blessing and the malediction, according to all that is written in the book of the law.” Half the congregation stood in front of Mount Ebal and the other half in front of Mount Gerizim, the ark of the covenant and the Levites being between the two groups.

The rainy season for Palestine begins about mid-October, lasting several months. By December, Bethlehem, like Jerusalem, experiences frequent frost at night. Thus the fact that shepherds of Bethlehem were in the fields at night points to a time prior to the start of the rainy season. It is also most unlikely that Caesar Augustus would unnecessarily provoke the Jews by ordering a registration in the wintry and rainy month of December, when traveling is particularly difficult.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000694/23/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 2:1-6</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000694/24/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 24:20</a>.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sn\"><strong><em>Have archaeologists found evidence of the destruction of Jericho in the days of Joshua?</em></strong></p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Professor John Garstang, leader of an English expedition at Tell es-Sultan between 1929 and 1936, found that what he considered to be one of the cities built on the site had been subjected to intense fires and its walls had fallen. This city he identified with the Jericho of Joshua’s time and assigned its destruction to about 1400 B.C.E. Although some scholars today still endorse Garstang’s conclusions, others interpret the evidence differently. Writes archaeologist G. Ernest Wright: “The two walls which surrounded the summit of the old city, which Garstang . . . believed were destroyed by earthquake and fire in Joshua’s time, were discovered to date from the 3rd millennium and to represent only two of some fourteen different walls or wall-components built successively during that age.” (<em>Biblical Archaeology,</em> 1962, pp. 79, 80) Many feel that little, if anything, remains of the Jericho that existed in Joshua’s time, earlier excavations at the site having removed what might have survived from the time of its destruction. As Professor Jack Finegan notes: “There is now, therefore, virtually no evidence at the site by which to try to determine at what date Joshua might have taken Jericho.”​—<em>Light From the Ancient Past,</em> 1959, p. 159.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">For this reason numerous scholars date the fall of Jericho on circumstantial evidence, and suggested dates span a period of about 200 years. In view of such uncertainty, Professor Merrill F. Unger fittingly observes: “Scholars also must be extremely wary of attaching undue authority to archeologists’ estimates of dates and interpretation of data. That the fixing of dates and the conclusions drawn from archeological findings often depend on subjective factors is amply demonstrated by the wide divergences between competent authorities on these matters.”​—<em>Archaeology and the Old Testament,</em> 1964, p. 164.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Therefore, the fact that the interpretations of archaeologists do not agree with Biblical chronology in pointing to 1473 B.C.E. as the date for Jericho’s destruction is no reason for concern. The difference in the viewpoint of Garstang and other archaeologists about Jericho illustrates the need for caution in accepting archaeological testimony regardless of whether it seems to confirm or to contradict the Bible record and its chronology.</p>",

Additionally, it was one of the principal cities of Judah (along with Jerusalem and Hebron), and this was not only because it had an excellent supply of water as compared with the surrounding region, thus allowing for both farming and grazing of herds and flocks, but also because important roads converged on it from several directions. From Egypt an ancient route led up by the “Way of the Wells” through Kadesh-barnea to Beer-sheba, being joined by another road over which traveled the camel caravans from the “Spice Kingdoms” of the Arabian Peninsula, heading for Philistia or Judah. From Ezion-geber, at the head of the Gulf of ʽAqaba, another route led up through the Arabah and then turned W, climbing the Ascent of Akrabbim to Beer-sheba. At Gaza, in the Philistine Plain, a road branching from the highway led SE to Beer-sheba.

After feasting and drinking, they arose early the next morning and made sworn statements one to the other.

Unlike the other Canaanites, the Gibeonites realized that despite their military strength and the greatness of their city, resistance would fail because Jehovah was fighting for Israel. Therefore, after the destruction of Jericho and Ai, the men of Gibeon, apparently also representing the three other Hivite cities of Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001682/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 9:17</a>), sent a delegation to Joshua at Gilgal to sue for peace. The Gibeonite ambassadors​—dressed in worn-out <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>garments and sandals and having burst, skin wine-bottles, worn-out sacks, and dry, crumbly bread—​represented themselves as being from a distant land, hence not in the way of Israel’s conquests. They acknowledged Jehovah’s hand in what had earlier befallen Egypt and the Amorite kings Sihon and Og. But wisely they did not mention what had happened to Jericho and Ai, as such news could not have reached their “very distant land” before the supposed departure.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Shortly thereafter, the ruse was uncovered. But the covenant remained in force; breaking it would have called Israel’s trustworthiness into question and brought Jehovah’s name into contempt among the other nations. When Joshua confronted the Gibeonites about their craftiness, they again acknowledged Jehovah’s dealing with Israel and then placed themselves at his mercy, saying: “Now here we are, in your hand. Just as it is good and right in your eyes to do to us, do.” They were then constituted gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001682/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 9:16-27</a>.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">Throughout the centuries, the original Gibeonites continued to exist as a people, although King Saul schemed to destroy them. The Gibeonites, however, patiently waited on Jehovah to reveal the injustice. This he did by means of a three-year famine in David’s reign. Upon inquiring of Jehovah and learning that bloodguilt was involved, David interviewed the Gibeonites to ascertain what should be done to make atonement. The Gibeonites rightly answered that it was not “a matter of silver or gold,” because, according to the Law, no ransom could be accepted for a murderer. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001682/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nu 35:30, 31</a>) They also recognized that they could not put a man to death without legal authorization. Therefore, not until David’s further questioning did they request that seven “sons” of Saul be handed over to them. The fact that bloodguilt was upon both Saul and his household suggests that, although Saul probably took the lead in the murderous action, the “sons” of Saul may directly or indirectly have shared in it.

This supplementary material may have been included to show that even the tall Anakim, who had struck such fear in the hearts of Israel’s spies more than 40 years earlier (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nu 13:28,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/9/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 31-33;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/9/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> De 9:2</a>), had not proved invulnerable.</p>",

So, a second conquest or “mopping up” operation was effected at Debir by Othniel, who, because of distinguishing himself in the city’s conquest, was given Achsah, the daughter of veteran warrior Caleb, as a wife.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 15:13-19;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/12/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Jg 1:11-15</a>.</p>",

(<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 1:11-15</a>) This, according to some, would make Judah’s conquest of Debir subsequent to Joshua’s death and would mean that the similar account found at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001137/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joshua 15:13-19</a> was a later addition to the book bearing Joshua’s name.

Hence, they consider the Judges account to be a restatement of that in Joshua.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Various suggestions have been put forth by Biblical scholars regarding the location of Debir in the mountainous region of Judah. In the past it was identified with Tell Beit Mirsim, about 20 km <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>(12 mi) WSW of Hebron.

                "<p class=\"sb\">The capital city of the ancient nation of Israel from the year 1070 B.C.E. onward. Following the division of the nation into two kingdoms (997 B.C.E.), Jerusalem continued as the capital of the southern kingdom of Judah. Throughout the Scriptures there are more than 800 references to Jerusalem.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Name.</strong> The earliest recorded name of the city is “Salem.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 14:18</a>) Whereas some try to associate the meaning of the name Jerusalem with that of a West Semitic god named Shalem, the apostle Paul shows that “Peace” is the true meaning of the latter half of the name. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heb 7:2</a>) The Hebrew spelling of this latter half suggests a dual form, hence “Twofold Peace.” In Akkadian (Assyro-Babylonian) texts the city was called Urusalim (or Ur-sa-li-im-mu). On this basis some scholars give the meaning of the name as “City of Peace.” But the Hebrew form, which logically ought to govern, apparently means “Possession (Foundation) of Twofold Peace.”</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Many other expressions and titles were used in the Scriptures to refer to the city. The psalmist on one occasion uses the earlier name, “Salem.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 76:2</a>) Other appellations were: “city of Jehovah” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 60:14</a>), “town of the grand King” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 48:2</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 5:35</a>), “City of Righteousness” and “Faithful Town” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 1:26</a>), “Zion” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 33:20</a>), and “holy city” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ne 11:1;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Isa 48:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 52:1;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Mt 4:5</a>).

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Location.</strong> Comparatively remote from principal international trade routes, Jerusalem lay on the edge of an arid wilderness (the Wilderness of Judah), its water supplies being limited. Nevertheless, two <em>internal</em> trade routes did intersect near the city. One ran in a N-S direction along the top of the plateau forming the “backbone” of ancient Palestine, and this route linked together such cities as Dothan, Shechem, Bethel, Bethlehem, Hebron, and Beer-sheba. The second route ran in an E-W direction from Rabbah (modern ʽAmman), cut through torrent valleys to the Jordan River basin, ascended the steep Judean slopes, and then wound down the western slopes to the Mediterranean Coast and the seaport town of Joppa. Additionally, Jerusalem was centrally located for the whole area of the Promised Land, hence appropriate for a state administration center.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Lying about 55 km (34 mi) inland from the Mediterranean Sea and some 25 km (16 mi) due W of the northern end of the Dead Sea, Jerusalem rests among the hills of the central mountain range. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 125:2</a>.) Its altitude of about 750 m (2,500 ft) above sea level made it one of the highest capital cities in the world at that time. Its “loftiness” is mentioned in the Scriptures, and travelers had to ‘go up’ from the coastal plains to reach the city. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 48:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/10/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 122:3, 4</a>) The climate is pleasant, with cool nights, an average annual temperature of 17° C. (63° F.), and an average annual rainfall of about 63 cm (25 in.), the rain falling mainly between November and April.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Despite its height, Jerusalem does not stand up above the surrounding terrain. The traveler gets a full view of the city only when quite close. To the E, the Mount of Olives rises about 800 m (2,620 ft). North of it, Mount Scopus reaches about 820 m (2,690 ft), and the encircling hills on the S and W rise as high as 835 m (2,740 ft). These elevations give a view of the situation in relation to the Temple Mount (c. 740 m [2,430 ft]).</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In times of war, this situation would seem to constitute a serious disadvantage. Any drawback, however, was compensated for by the city’s being surrounded on three sides by steep-walled valleys: the torrent valley of Kidron on the east and <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>the Valley of Hinnom on the south and west. A central valley, apparently referred to by Josephus as the Tyropoeon Valley (or “the Valley of the Cheesemakers”), bisected the city area into eastern and western hills or spurs. (<em>The Jewish War,</em> V, 136, 140 [iv, 1]) This central valley has filled in considerably throughout the centuries, but a visitor still must make a rather sharp descent to a central hollow and then climb up the other side when crossing the city. There is evidence that, in addition to the N-S central valley, two smaller E-W valleys, or depressions, further divided the hills, one cutting across the eastern hill and the other across the western.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The steep valley walls seem to have been incorporated into the city’s defensive wall system in all periods. The only side of the city lacking in natural defense was that on the N, and here the walls were made especially strong. When attacking the city in 70 C.E., General Titus, according to Josephus, was faced with three successive walls on that side.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Water Supply.</strong> Jerusalem’s inhabitants suffered from serious food shortages in siege, but evidently had no great water problem. For, in spite of its nearness to the arid Judean Wilderness, the city had access to a constant supply of fresh water and had adequate storage facilities within the city walls.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Two springs, En-rogel and Gihon, were located near the city. The first lay a little S of the junction of the Kidron and Hinnom valleys. While a valuable source of water, its position made it inaccessible during times of attack or siege. The Gihon spring lay on the W side of the Kidron Valley, alongside what came to be called the City of David. Though outside the city walls, it was close enough that a tunnel could be excavated connecting to a shaft, enabling the city’s inhabitants to draw water without going outside the protective walls. This was done early in the city’s history, according to the archaeological evidence. In 1961 and 1962, excavations revealed a substantial early wall, situated <em>below</em> the upper end, or entrance, of the tunnel, hence enclosing it. It is thought to be the wall of the old Jebusite city.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Over the years, additional tunnels and canals were formed to channel Gihon’s waters. One channel ran from the mouth of the cave of the Gihon spring down the valley and around the end of the SE hill to a pool located at the junction of the Hinnom Valley with the central or Tyropoeon Valley. According to what has been found, it was in the form of a trench, covered with flat stones, and tunneled through the hillside at points. Openings at intervals allowed for water to be drawn off for irrigation of the valley terraces below. The canal’s gradient of about 4 or 5 millimeters per meter (less than 0.2 in. per yd) produced a slow gentle flow, reminding one of “the waters of the Shiloah that are going gently.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/11/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 8:6</a>) It is suggested that this canal, unprotected and vulnerable, was constructed during Solomon’s reign, when peace and security were predominant.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jerusalem’s homes and buildings were evidently equipped with underground cisterns, supplementing the supply of water from springs. Rainwater collected from the roofs was stored therein, kept clean and cool. The temple area seems to have had particularly large cisterns, archaeologists claiming to have plotted 37 cisterns there with a total capacity of about 38,000 kl (10,000,000 gal), one cistern alone estimated as capable of holding 7,600 kl (2,000,000 gal).</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Over the centuries a number of aqueducts, or conduits, were built, in order to provide water for Jerusalem. Tradition ascribes to Solomon the construction of a conduit from the “Pools of Solomon” (three reservoirs SW of Bethlehem) to the temple enclosure at Jerusalem. At <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ecclesiastes 2:6</a>, Solomon says: “I made pools of water for myself, to irrigate with them the forest.” Such a large undertaking as the building of the pools could well have included the building of a conduit for the larger supply of water that would be needed at Jerusalem after the temple services were instituted. However, there is no evidence, other than tradition, to support the Solomonic origin of a conduit from the Pools of Solomon to Jerusalem. A number of aqueducts can still be traced. One conduit constructed to carry water from springs in the Wadi el-ʽArrub 20 km (12 mi) SSW of Jerusalem to the Pools of Solomon is possibly the one alluded to by Josephus, who says that it was constructed by Pontius Pilate with temple treasury funds. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XVIII, 60 [iii, 2]; <em>The Jewish War,</em> II, 175 [ix, 4]) Of the two aqueducts leading from the Pools of Solomon to Jerusalem, the lower one is the older, possibly dating from the time of Herod or of the Hasmonaeans. This aqueduct passed under the village of Bethlehem and ran on to the Temple Mount over “Wilson’s Arch.”</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Archaeological Research.</strong> Though much research and excavation have been carried out, few concrete facts have been determined as to the city of Bible times. Various factors have restricted investigation or limited its value. Jerusalem has had almost continuous occupation in the Common Era, thus severely reducing the area available for excavation. <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>Then, too, the city was destroyed a number of times, with new cities built on top of the ruins and often made, in part, from material of those ruins. The piling up of debris and rubble, in some places about 30 m (100 ft) deep, has obscured the early contours of the site and made the interpretation of the excavated evidence a precarious task. Some wall sections, pools, water tunnels, and ancient tombs have been unearthed, but very little written material. Principal archaeological discoveries have come from the SE hill, which now lies outside the city walls.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The main sources of information regarding the ancient city, therefore, remain the Bible and the description of the first-century city given by Jewish historian Josephus.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Early History.</strong> The first historical mention of the city comes in the decade between 1943 and 1933 B.C.E., when Abraham’s encounter with Melchizedek took place. Melchizedek was “king of Salem” and “priest of the Most High God.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 14:17-20</a>) However, the origins of the city and of the population that composed it are as wrapped in obscurity as is the origin of its king-priest Melchizedek.​—Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heb 7:1-3</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Apparently another event in Abraham’s life involved the vicinity of Jerusalem. Abraham was commanded to offer up his son Isaac on “one of the mountains” in “the land of Moriah.” The temple built by Solomon was erected on “Mount Moriah” on a site that previously had been a threshing floor. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/15/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 22:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/15/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2Ch 3:1</a>) Thus, the Bible apparently links the place of Abraham’s attempted sacrifice with the mountainous region around Jerusalem. (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MORIAH</a>.) Whether Melchizedek was still living then is not revealed; but Salem likely remained friendly territory for Abraham.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The Amarna Tablets, written by Canaanite rulers to their Egyptian overlord, include seven letters from the king or governor of Jerusalem (Urusalim). These letters were written prior to the Israelite conquest of Canaan. Thus, Jerusalem, in the approximately 465-year period between Abraham’s meeting with Melchizedek and the Israelite conquest, had become the possession of pagan Hamitic Canaanites and was under the domination of the Hamitic Egyptian Empire.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The account of Joshua’s sweeping conquest of Canaan lists Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, among the confederate kings attacking Gibeon. His name (meaning “(My) Lord Is Righteousness”) closely parallels that of Jerusalem’s earlier King Melchizedek (“King of Righteousness”), but Adoni-zedek was no worshiper of the Most High God, Jehovah.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 10:1-5,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 23,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 26;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12:7, 8,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 10</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In the allotting of tribal territories, Jerusalem was on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin, the specific border running along the Valley of Hinnom. This would place at least what comprised the later “City of David,” situated on the ridge between the Kidron and Tyropoeon valleys, within the territory of Benjamin. Apparently the Canaanite city had additional settlements, or “suburbs,” however, and part of the settled area may have overlapped into Judah’s territory to the W and S of the Valley of Hinnom. Judah is credited with the initial capture of Jerusalem at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Judges 1:8</a>, but after the invading forces moved on, the Jebusite inhabitants apparently remained (or returned) in sufficient force to form a later pocket of resistance that neither Judah nor Benjamin could break. Thus, of both Judah and Benjamin it is said that the ‘Jebusites continued dwelling with them in Jerusalem.’ (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/18/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 15:63;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/18/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Jg 1:21</a>) This situation continued for some four centuries, and the city was at times referred to as “Jebus,” “a city of foreigners.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 19:10-12;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/19/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1Ch 11:4, 5</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>During the United Kingdom.</strong> King Saul’s headquarters were at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin. King David’s capital city was first at Hebron in Judah, about 30 km (19 mi) SSW of Jerusalem.

                "<p class=\"sb\">It seems that the Jebusites at that time had their city on the southern end of the eastern spur. They were confident of the impregnability of their fortress city, with its natural defenses of steep valley walls on three sides and, probably, special fortifications on the north. It was known as “the place difficult to approach” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/24/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ch 11:7</a>), and the Jebusites taunted David that even ‘the blind and the lame of the city’ could hold off his attacks. But David conquered the city, his attack being spearheaded by Joab, who evidently gained entry into the city by means of “the water tunnel.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/25/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:6-9;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/25/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1Ch 11:4-8</a>) Scholars are not entirely certain of the meaning of the Hebrew term here rendered “water tunnel,” but generally accept this or similar terms (“water shaft,” <em>RS, AT;</em> “gutter,” <em>JP</em>) as the most likely meaning. The brief account does not state just how the city’s defenses were breached. Since the discovery of the tunnel and shaft leading to the Gihon spring, the popular view is that Joab led men up this vertical shaft, through the sloping tunnel and into the city in a surprise attack. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 951) By whatever means, the city was taken and David <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>moved his capital there (1070 B.C.E.). The Jebusite stronghold now came to be known as “the City of David,” also called “Zion.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/26/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:7</a>.</p>",

On one occasion, however, David saw fit to abandon the city before the advance of rebel forces led by his own son, Absalom. The king’s retreat may have been to avoid having blood shed in civil war at this place where Jehovah’s name rested. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/32/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 15:13-17</a>) Whatever the motive for the retreat, it led to the fulfillment of the inspired prophecy spoken by Nathan.

The hewn stones prepared may have been quarried in that area, for the bedrock of Jerusalem itself is easily cut and chiseled to size and shape, yet, upon exposure to the weather, hardens into durable and attractive building stones.

                "<p class=\"sb\">A further view of the layout of the terrain around Jerusalem, this time to the E and S, is given in the account of the anointing of Solomon by order of aged King David. Another son, Adonijah, was at the spring of En-rogel, plotting to seize the kingship, when Solomon was anointed at the spring of Gihon. The distance between the two points was short enough (c. 700 m; 2,300 ft) that Adonijah and his coconspirators heard the noise of the horn and celebrations at Gihon.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/38/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 1:5-9,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/38/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 32-41</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Solomon’s reign saw considerable building (and perhaps rebuilding) done within the city and expansion of its limits.

Within five years of Solomon’s death, the city experienced the first of a number of invasions. King Shishak of Egypt attacked the kingdom of Judah, doubtless viewing it as vulnerable in its reduced state.

True worship brought Jehovah’s blessing and protection; apostasy led to grave problems and vulnerability to attack.

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Hellenic and Maccabean Control.</strong> The changeover from Medo-Persian to Greek control came in 332 B.C.E. when Alexander the Great marched through Judah. The Greek historians make no mention of Alexander’s entry into Jerusalem. Yet the city did come under Greek dominion, and it is reasonable to assume that it was not completely bypassed by Alexander. Josephus, in the first century C.E., records the Jewish tradition that, upon approaching Jerusalem, Alexander was met by the Jewish high priest and was shown the divinely inspired prophecies recorded by Daniel foretelling the lightning conquests by Greece. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XI, 326-338 [viii, 4, 5]; <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/86/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Da 8:5-7,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/86/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 20, 21</a>) Whatever the case, Jerusalem seems to have survived the change in control free of any damage.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Following Alexander’s death, Jerusalem and Judea came under the control of the Ptolemies, who ruled out of Egypt. In 198 B.C.E. Antiochus the Great, ruling in Syria, after taking the fortified city of Sidon, captured Jerusalem, and Judea became a dominion of the Seleucid Empire. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/87/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Da 11:16</a>.) Jerusalem lay under Seleucid rule for 30 years. Then, in the year 168 B.C.E., Syrian King Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), in his attempt to Hellenize completely the Jews, dedicated Jerusalem’s temple to Zeus (Jupiter) and profaned the altar by an unclean sacrifice. (1 Maccabees 1:57, 62; 2 Maccabees 6:1, 2, 5; PICTURES, Vol. 2, p. 335) This led to the Maccabean (or Hasmonaean) revolt. After a three-year struggle, Judas Maccabaeus gained control of the city and temple and <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>rededicated Jehovah’s altar to true worship on the anniversary of its profanation, Chislev 25, 165 B.C.E.​—1 Maccabees 4:52-54; 2 Maccabees 10:5; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/88/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 10:22</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The war against the Seleucid rulers had not ended. The Jews appealed to Rome for help and thus a new power came on the Jerusalem scene in about 160 B.C.E. (1 Maccabees 8:17, 18) Now Jerusalem began to come under the influence of the expanding Roman Empire. About 142 B.C.E., Simon Maccabaeus was able to make Jerusalem the capital of a region ostensibly free from subservience to or taxation by Gentile nations. Aristobulus I, Jerusalem’s high priest, even assumed the title of king in 104 B.C.E. He was not, however, of the Davidic line.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jerusalem was no ‘city of peace’ during this period. Internal quarrels, fired by selfish ambitions and worsened by rival religious factions​—Sadducees, Pharisees, Zealots, and others—​gravely weakened the city. A violent quarrel between Aristobulus II and his brother Hyrcanus resulted in Rome’s being called on to arbitrate the dispute. Under General Pompey, Roman forces besieged Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. for three months in order to enter the city and settle the dispute. Twelve thousand Jews reportedly died, many at the hands of fellow Israelites.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">It is in Josephus’ account of Pompey’s conquest that the archway across the Tyropoeon Valley is first mentioned. It served as a link between the eastern and western halves of the city and gave those on the western half direct access to the temple area.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The Idumean Antipater (II) was now installed as Roman governor for Judea, a Maccabean being left as high priest and local ethnarch in Jerusalem. Later, Antipater’s son Herod (the Great) was appointed by Rome as “king” over Judea. He did not get control of Jerusalem until 37 or 36 B.C.E., from which date his rule effectively began.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Under Herod the Great.</strong> Herod’s rule was marked by an ambitious building program, and the city enjoyed considerable prosperity. A theater, gymnasium, and hippodrome (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 535), as well as other public buildings, were added. Herod also built a well-fortified royal palace (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 538), evidently on the W side of the city S of the present-day Jaffa Gate, where archaeologists believe they have found the foundation of one of the towers. Another fortress, the Tower of Antonia, lay near the temple and was connected with it by a passageway. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 535; <em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XV, 424 [xi, 7]) The Roman garrison could thus gain quick access to the temple area, as likely occurred when soldiers rescued Paul from a mob there.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/89/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ac 21:31, 32</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Herod’s greatest work, however, was the reconstruction of the temple and its building complex. Beginning in his 18th year (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XV, 380 [xi, 1]), the holy house itself was completed in a year and a half, but the work on the adjoining buildings and courtyards went on long after his death.

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>From 2 B.C.E. to 70 C.E.</strong> The Christian Greek Scriptures now carry forward the description of events involving Jerusalem.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Jesus was taken to Jerusalem 40 days after birth and presented at the temple as Mary’s firstborn.

How many other times he was taken to Jerusalem during his childhood years is not stated, only one visit, made when he was 12, being specifically recorded.

The witnessing done by the spirit-filled Christians resulted in thousands becoming baptized disciples. With thousands bearing witness to their faith, it is no wonder the angry religious leaders cried: “Look! you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/118/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ac 5:28</a>) Miracles performed added power to the testimony, as, for example, the healing of the lame beggar at “the temple door that was called Beautiful,” likely the E gate of the Court of Women.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/119/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ac 3:2,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/119/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 6, 7</a>.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">Jesus had called Jerusalem “the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent forth to her.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/127/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 23:37</a>; compare vss <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/128/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">34-36</a>.) Though many of her citizens showed faith in God’s Son, the city as a whole continued to follow the pattern of the past.

Suddenly Cestius Gallus withdrew for no apparent reason. This allowed Christians to put into action Jesus’ instructions: “Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains, and let those in the midst of [Jerusalem] withdraw, and let those in the country places not enter into her.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/130/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 21:20-22</a>) Eusebius, in his <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> (III, V, 3), states that the Christians fled from Jerusalem and the whole land of Judea to a city of Perea that was called Pella.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jerusalem’s relief as a result of the Roman withdrawal was short-lived, as it had been when the Babylonians temporarily withdrew to deal with the Egyptians near the end of King Zedekiah’s reign. Under General Titus the Roman forces returned in 70 C.E. in increased numbers and laid siege to the city, now crowded with Passover celebrants. Siege banks were thrown up by the Romans, and a continuous wall or fence was erected around the entire city to prevent escape by day or night. This, too, fulfilled Jesus’ prophecy. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/131/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 19:43</a>) Within the city rival factions quarreled and fought, much of the food supply was destroyed, and those caught attempting to leave the city were slain as traitors. Josephus, the source of this information, relates that in time the famine became so grave that the people were reduced to eating wisps of hay and leather, even their own children. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/132/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">La 2:11, 12,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/132/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 19, 20;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/132/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> De 28:56, 57</a>.) Titus’ offers of peace were consistently rejected by the stubborn city leaders.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Eventually the walls were systematically breached by the Romans, and their troops invaded the city. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 752) Despite orders to the contrary, the temple was burned and gutted. According to Josephus, this took place on the anniversary of Nebuchadnezzar’s destruction of the first temple centuries earlier. His account also states that the repository of the archives, housing the genealogical records of tribal and family descent and inheritance rights, was put to the fire. (<em>The Jewish War,</em> VI, 250, 251 [iv, 5]; II, 426-428 [xvii, 6]; VI, 354 [vi, 3]) Thus, the legal means for establishing the lineage of members of the Messianic tribe of Judah and the priestly tribe of Levi came to an end.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In just 4 months and 25 days, from April 3 to August 30, 70 C.E., the conquest had been effected. Thus, the tribulation, though intense, was remarkably short. The unreasoning attitude and actions of the Jews within the city doubtless <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>contributed to this shortness. Though Josephus puts the number of dead at 1,100,000, there were survivors. Ninety-seven thousand captives were taken, many of whom were sent as slaves to Egypt or were killed by sword or beasts in the theaters of the Roman provinces. This, too, fulfilled divine prophecy.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/133/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 28:68</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The entire city was demolished, with only the towers of Herod’s palace and a portion of the western wall left standing as evidence to later generations of the defensive strength that had availed nothing. Josephus remarks that, apart from these remnants, “the rest of the wall encompassing the city was so completely levelled to the ground as to leave future visitors to the spot no ground for believing that it had ever been inhabited.” (<em>The Jewish War,</em> VII, 3 [i, 1]) A relief on the Arch of Titus in Rome depicts Roman soldiers carrying off sacred vessels of the ruined temple.​—Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/134/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 24:2</a>; PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 752.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Later Periods.</strong> Jerusalem remained virtually desolate until about 130 C.E., when Emperor Hadrian ordered the building of a new city, named Aelia Capitolina. This provoked a Jewish revolt by Bar Kokhba (132-135 C.E.), which succeeded for a time but was then crushed. Jews were not allowed in the Roman-built city for nearly two centuries. In the fourth century, Constantine the Great’s mother Helena visited Jerusalem and began the identification of the many so-called holy sites and shrines. Later the Muslims captured the city. Today there are two Islamic structures on the Temple Mount. Late in the seventh century Caliph ʽAbd al-Malik ibn Marwan built the Dome of the Rock on or near the temple site. Although also called a mosque, it is in reality a shrine. South of the Dome of the Rock is the el-Aqsa mosque, first constructed in the eighth century, but largely rebuilt in the eleventh century.</p>",

However, both Dan and Beer-sheba were situated at natural frontiers of the land. In the case of Beer-sheba, its position was below the mountains of Judah on the edge of the desert. Additionally, it was one of the principal cities of Judah (along with Jerusalem and Hebron), and this was not only because it had an excellent supply of water as compared with the surrounding region, thus allowing for both farming and grazing of herds and flocks, but also because important roads converged on it from several directions. From Egypt an ancient route led up by the “Way of the Wells” through Kadesh-barnea to Beer-sheba, being joined by another road over which traveled the camel caravans from the “Spice Kingdoms” of the Arabian Peninsula, heading for Philistia or Judah. From Ezion-geber, at the head of the Gulf of ʽAqaba, another route led up through the Arabah and then turned W, climbing the Ascent of Akrabbim to Beer-sheba. At Gaza, in the Philistine Plain, a road branching from the highway led SE to Beer-sheba.

When Abraham severely criticized Abimelech for his servants’ act of violence in seizing the well, Abimelech avowed his ignorance, concluded a covenant with Abraham, and accepted seven female lambs from him in evidence of Abraham’s title to the well. “That is why [Abraham] called that place Beer-sheba, because there both of them had taken an oath.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 21:31</a>) Abraham then planted a tamarisk tree there and called upon “the name of Jehovah the indefinitely lasting God.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 21:33</a>) It was from Beer-sheba that Abraham went to Moriah to offer Isaac as a sacrifice, and he returned there to dwell.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 22:19</a>.</p>",

After feasting and drinking, they arose early the next morning and made sworn statements one to the other.

Standing opposite each other, these mountains are the most eminent ones of the region and guard a significant E-W pass. Between the two mountains is a fertile valley, the Valley of Shechem, in which present-day Nablus is situated. Shechem, a strong and important city of Canaan before the Israelites entered the Promised Land, stood at the eastern end of the valley, about 1.5 km (1 mi) SE of Nablus.

The tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin stood in front of Mount Gerizim. The Levites and the ark of the covenant were situated in the valley, and the other six tribes stood in front of Mount Ebal.

But the Bible does not state that the city was burned, as it does in the case of Jericho (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002659/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 6:24, 25</a>), Ai (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002659/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 8:28</a>), and Hazor (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002659/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 11:11</a>).

It is also noteworthy that the Ramses to whom the scarab should be assigned cannot be definitely ascertained. At least one archaeologist attributed the scarab to Ramses III and advanced the thought that Lachish was destroyed by the Philistines in the 12th century B.C.E.</p>",

Through his chief spokesman Rabshakeh, Sennacherib defied Jehovah and later sent messengers to Jerusalem with letters of continued taunt and threat designed to bring about Hezekiah’s surrender. This defiance of Jehovah God finally led to the annihilation by God’s angel of 185,000 Assyrian warriors in one night.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002659/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ki 18:14,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002659/10/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 17-35;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002659/10/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 19:8-13,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002659/10/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 32-35;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002659/10/4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Isa 36:1-20;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002659/10/5\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 37:8-13,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002659/10/6\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 33-36</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">A portrayal of the siege of Lachish, from Sennacherib’s palace at Nineveh, indicates that the city was encompassed by a double wall having towers at regular intervals and that palms, grapes, and figs flourished in the surrounding hilly area. The scene showing Sennacherib receiving the spoils of Lachish is accompanied by the following inscription: “Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, sat upon a <em>nimedu -</em>throne and passed in review the booty (taken) from Lachish (<em>La-ki-su</em>).”​—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts</em>, edited by J. B. Pritchard, 1974, p. 288.</p>",

One of these letters, evidently directed by a military outpost to the commander at Lachish, reads in part: “We are watching for the signals of Lachish, according to all the indications which my lord hath given, for we cannot see Azekah.” This message suggests that Azekah had already been taken so that no signals were received from there. It is also of interest that nearly all the legible Lachish Letters contain words such as “May יהוה [Yahweh or Jehovah] cause my lord to hear this very day tidings of good!” (Lachish Ostracon IV) This shows that the divine name was then in common use.​—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 322.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">As noted previously, Bethlehem was not listed among the cities of Judah in the accounts of the tribal divisions.

The Jewish people understood this prophecy to mean that the Messiah or Christ would be born in and proceed from that town (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000694/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 7:40-42</a>), a belief also expressed by their chief priests and scribes.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000694/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 2:3-6</a>.</p>",

The rainy season for Palestine begins about mid-October, lasting several months. By December, Bethlehem, like Jerusalem, experiences frequent frost at night. Thus the fact that shepherds of Bethlehem were in the fields at night points to a time prior to the start of the rainy season. It is also most unlikely that Caesar Augustus would unnecessarily provoke the Jews by ordering a registration in the wintry and rainy month of December, when traveling is particularly difficult.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000694/23/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 2:1-6</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000694/24/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 24:20</a>.</p>",

It is identified with the ruins by the modern village of Beitin, about 17 km (11 mi) N of Jerusalem. It thus lay on a rocky ridge in the extreme southern part of the mountainous region of Ephraim at about 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level. The surrounding area today is quite barren, consisting of a stony plateau with sparse vegetation. Yet the existence of several springs there shows that the ancient city had an excellent water supply.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Bethel’s position was strategic and contributed greatly to its importance. Situated on the backbone of the central mountain range, it was on the important N-S route that followed the watershed line, running all the way from Shechem southward through Bethel, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron, and down to Beer-sheba. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 21:19</a>.) Another route connected Bethel with Joppa to the W on the Mediterranean and with Jericho to the E near the Jordan. Bethel was thus a crossroads town, as were Samaria, Jerusalem, Hebron, and Beer-sheba. Additionally, the evidence indicates that the area between Jerusalem and Bethel was a region of dense population, having a greater concentration of towns than any other part of Palestine.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Archaeological excavations at Beitin reveal it to be a site of great antiquity, the suggestion being given that the original settlement dated back to about the 21st century B.C.E. Evidence was also found of a severe destruction and conflagration leaving debris and ashes 1.5 m (c. 5 ft) deep in some places, and this is believed likely to have occurred during the conquest of Canaan by Israel.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Upon Abraham’s entry into Canaan, he stopped at Shechem and then moved S “to the mountainous region to the east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 12:8</a>) After spending some time in Egypt because of a famine in Canaan, Abraham again settled to the E of Bethel, in company with his nephew Lot. Since in both cases Abraham pitched tent to the E of Bethel, it is suggested that the site of his encampment was at Burj Beitin, a short distance SE of Beitin, which has been called “one of the great view-points of Palestine.” (<em>Encyclopædia Biblica,</em> edited by T. K. Cheyne, London, 1899, Vol. I, col. 552) It may have been from such a vantage point that Abraham invited Lot to select the direction in which he would go upon separating from Abraham, with the result that Lot “raised his eyes and saw the whole District of the Jordan” and decided in favor of that region. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 13:8-11</a>) Jehovah thereafter invited Abraham to view the land in all directions, assuring him that it would be for an inheritance to him and his seed.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 13:14, 15</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Although Moses, in compiling the Genesis account, speaks of the town near which Abraham camped as “Bethel,” the subsequent record shows its original Canaanite name to have been “Luz.” (See <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LUZ</a> No. 1.) Jacob spent the night near the city when traveling from Beer-sheba to Haran, and after having a dream of a ladder reaching to the heavens and hearing God’s confirmation of the Abrahamic promise, he thereafter set up a pillar and called the name of the place Bethel, although “Luz was the city’s name formerly.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 28:10-19</a>) Some 20 years later God spoke to Jacob at Haran, identifying himself as the one who had addressed Jacob at Bethel, and instructed him to return to Canaan.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 31:13</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Following the defilement of Dinah at Shechem and the act of vengeance executed by Jacob’s sons against the Shechemites, Jacob received God’s instruction to return to Bethel. After eliminating false religious articles from his household and servants, he traveled to Bethel under divine protection, built an altar there, and restated the name he had given the place earlier, calling it El-bethel, meaning “The God of Bethel.” Here Rebekah’s nursing woman Deborah died and was buried. Here, too, Jehovah confirmed the change of Jacob’s name to Israel, restating the Abrahamic promise.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 35:1-16</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Centuries later, upon the entry of the nation of Israel into Canaan (1473 B.C.E.), the name Bethel is again used to refer to the city previously called <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>Luz rather than to the camping site of Abraham and Jacob. In the account of the attack upon Ai, the record indicates that the Canaanite men of Bethel endeavored to support the men of that neighboring city, but to no avail. If not at that point, then at a later time Bethel’s king met defeat by Joshua’s forces. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 7:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/7/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 8:9,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/7/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/7/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 17;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/7/4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12:9,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/7/5\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 16</a>) Bethel thereafter appears as a boundary city between the territories of the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin. It is listed as assigned to Benjamin, but the record shows that it was the house of Joseph (of which Ephraim was a part) that effected the conquest of the city. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 16:1, 2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/8/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 18:13,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/8/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 21, 22;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/8/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Jg 1:22-26</a>) From this point forward the name Luz is no longer applied to the city.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">Bethel was on the circuit visited by Samuel as he judged the people annually at that city as well as at Gilgal and Mizpah, and it was still viewed as a place favored for worship. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/11/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Sa 7:16;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/11/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 10:3</a>) However, from then till the division of the kingdom (997 B.C.E.), Bethel is mentioned only in connection with King Saul’s stationing of troops in preparation for combat with the Philistines.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Sa 13:2</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">As a major city of the northern kingdom under Jeroboam, Bethel, once prominent as a place of revelation by the true God, now became renowned as a center of false worship. At Bethel, in the extreme S of the newly formed kingdom of Israel, and at Dan, in the extreme N thereof, Jeroboam set up the golden calves in his effort to dissuade the people of his realm from going to the temple at Jerusalem. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 12:27-29</a>) With its own religious house and altar, a specially invented festival time, and priests selected from among the non-Levitical tribes, Bethel became a symbol of rank apostasy from true worship. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 12:31-33</a>) Jehovah God did not delay in expressing his disapproval through a “man of the true God” sent to Bethel to pronounce judgment against the altar used in connection with calf worship. The ripping apart of this altar served as a portent, confirming the sure fulfillment of the prophet’s words. After leaving Bethel, however, this “man of the true God” allowed himself to be induced by an old prophet of Bethel to accept and act on a supposed message from an angel in violation of the direct orders from God, with disastrous consequences to himself. Slain by a lion, he was buried at Bethel in the personal burial place of the old prophet who saw in all these events the certainty of the fulfillment of Jehovah’s word and thus requested that his own body be buried at death in the same burial site.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/15/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 13:1-32</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">King Abijah of Judah temporarily wrested Bethel and other towns from the control of the northern kingdom (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ch 13:19, 20</a>), but it appears that Bethel had been restored to the northern kingdom at least by the time of King Baasha of Israel, since he endeavored to fortify Ramah, considerably to the S of Bethel. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 15:17;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/17/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2Ch 16:1</a>) Even though King Jehu later eradicated Baal worship from Israel, the golden calves continued undisturbed at Dan and Bethel.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/18/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ki 10:28, 29</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Despite the prevalence of false worship there, the record shows Bethel as the location of a group of prophets in the time of Elijah and Elisha. Bethel was also the home of the group of jeering boys who mocked Elisha, this costing many of them their lives as a result of divine execution.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ki 2:1-3,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/19/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 23, 24</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The prophets Amos and Hosea, in the late ninth and mid-eighth centuries B.C.E., proclaimed God’s condemnation of the religious corruption centered at Bethel. Although Hosea makes direct mention of Bethel (meaning “House of God”) only when recalling God’s revelation of himself to faithful Jacob there (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ho 12:4</a>), he evidently employs the name “Beth-aven,” meaning “House of Hurtfulness (Something Hurtful),” as applying to that city and the effect of its false religious practices. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/21/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ho 4:15;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/21/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 5:8</a>) He warns that its calf idol served by foreign-god priests will come to be a cause for mourning to idolatrous Israel, its high places will be annihilated, and thorns and thistles will cover its altars; while the people, faced with exile in Assyria, cry out to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall over us!” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/22/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ho 10:5-8</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/23/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 23:30;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/23/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Re 6:16</a>.) The prophet Amos spoke in similar vein, showing that, no matter how frequent the sacrifices offered by the people at Bethel’s altars, their pious pilgrimages to that place only constituted the commission of transgression, and warning that Jehovah’s burning anger would blaze against them inextinguishably. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/24/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Am 3:14;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/24/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 4:4;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/24/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 5:5, 6</a>) Angered at this prophesying done by Amos right in Bethel, the apostate priest Amaziah accused Amos of seditious talk and ordered him to ‘go back to Judah where he came from’ and there do his prophesying: “But at Bethel you must no longer do any further prophesying, for it is the sanctuary of a king and it is the house of a kingdom.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000682/25/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Am 7:10-13</a>.</p>",

During or following Josiah’s 18th year of rule (642 B.C.E.), he extended his purge of false religion up into Bethel and also to the cities of Samaria. Josiah destroyed the site of idolatrous worship in Bethel, first burning the bones from nearby tombs on the altar, thereby desecrating it in fulfillment of the prophecy given by “the man of the true God” over three centuries earlier.

When word about their assembly at Mizpah reached the Philistines, they took advantage of the situation to launch an attack. But Jehovah threw the enemy into confusion, enabling the Israelites to subdue the foe. Apparently to commemorate this God-given victory, Samuel erected a stone between Mizpah and Jeshanah, calling it Ebenezer (meaning “Stone of Help”). Thereafter Samuel continued judging Israel and, as he did so, made a yearly circuit of Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah.

Gedaliah administered affairs from Mizpah. There the prophet Jeremiah took up residence. Also, surviving army chiefs and other Jews who had been scattered came to Mizpah. Governor Gedaliah, although having been forewarned, failed to exercise caution and was assassinated at Mizpah. Chaldeans and Jews with him there were likewise slaughtered. Thereafter 70 visiting men also met their death. The band of assassins, led by Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, took the rest of the people captive. Overtaken by Johanan the son of Kareah, Ishmael escaped with eight men, but the captives were rescued, later to be taken to Egypt.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003093/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ki 25:23-26;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003093/10/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Jer 40:5–41:18</a>.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">The capital city of the ancient nation of Israel from the year 1070 B.C.E. onward. Following the division of the nation into two kingdoms (997 B.C.E.), Jerusalem continued as the capital of the southern kingdom of Judah. Throughout the Scriptures there are more than 800 references to Jerusalem.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Name.</strong> The earliest recorded name of the city is “Salem.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 14:18</a>) Whereas some try to associate the meaning of the name Jerusalem with that of a West Semitic god named Shalem, the apostle Paul shows that “Peace” is the true meaning of the latter half of the name. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heb 7:2</a>) The Hebrew spelling of this latter half suggests a dual form, hence “Twofold Peace.” In Akkadian (Assyro-Babylonian) texts the city was called Urusalim (or Ur-sa-li-im-mu). On this basis some scholars give the meaning of the name as “City of Peace.” But the Hebrew form, which logically ought to govern, apparently means “Possession (Foundation) of Twofold Peace.”</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Many other expressions and titles were used in the Scriptures to refer to the city. The psalmist on one occasion uses the earlier name, “Salem.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 76:2</a>) Other appellations were: “city of Jehovah” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 60:14</a>), “town of the grand King” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 48:2</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 5:35</a>), “City of Righteousness” and “Faithful Town” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 1:26</a>), “Zion” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 33:20</a>), and “holy city” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ne 11:1;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Isa 48:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 52:1;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/8/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Mt 4:5</a>). The name “el Quds,” meaning “the Holy [City],” is still the popular name for it in Arabic. The name shown on present-day maps of Israel is Yerushalayim.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Location.</strong> Comparatively remote from principal international trade routes, Jerusalem lay on the edge of an arid wilderness (the Wilderness of Judah), its water supplies being limited. Nevertheless, two <em>internal</em> trade routes did intersect near the city. One ran in a N-S direction along the top of the plateau forming the “backbone” of ancient Palestine, and this route linked together such cities as Dothan, Shechem, Bethel, Bethlehem, Hebron, and Beer-sheba. The second route ran in an E-W direction from Rabbah (modern ʽAmman), cut through torrent valleys to the Jordan River basin, ascended the steep Judean slopes, and then wound down the western slopes to the Mediterranean Coast and the seaport town of Joppa. Additionally, Jerusalem was centrally located for the whole area of the Promised Land, hence appropriate for a state administration center.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Lying about 55 km (34 mi) inland from the Mediterranean Sea and some 25 km (16 mi) due W of the northern end of the Dead Sea, Jerusalem rests among the hills of the central mountain range. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 125:2</a>.) Its altitude of about 750 m (2,500 ft) above sea level made it one of the highest capital cities in the world at that time. Its “loftiness” is mentioned in the Scriptures, and travelers had to ‘go up’ from the coastal plains to reach the city. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 48:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/10/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 122:3, 4</a>) The climate is pleasant, with cool nights, an average annual temperature of 17° C. (63° F.), and an average annual rainfall of about 63 cm (25 in.), the rain falling mainly between November and April.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Despite its height, Jerusalem does not stand up above the surrounding terrain. The traveler gets a full view of the city only when quite close. To the E, the Mount of Olives rises about 800 m (2,620 ft). North of it, Mount Scopus reaches about 820 m (2,690 ft), and the encircling hills on the S and W rise as high as 835 m (2,740 ft). These elevations give a view of the situation in relation to the Temple Mount (c. 740 m [2,430 ft]).</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In times of war, this situation would seem to constitute a serious disadvantage. Any drawback, however, was compensated for by the city’s being surrounded on three sides by steep-walled valleys: the torrent valley of Kidron on the east and <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>the Valley of Hinnom on the south and west. A central valley, apparently referred to by Josephus as the Tyropoeon Valley (or “the Valley of the Cheesemakers”), bisected the city area into eastern and western hills or spurs. (<em>The Jewish War,</em> V, 136, 140 [iv, 1]) This central valley has filled in considerably throughout the centuries, but a visitor still must make a rather sharp descent to a central hollow and then climb up the other side when crossing the city. There is evidence that, in addition to the N-S central valley, two smaller E-W valleys, or depressions, further divided the hills, one cutting across the eastern hill and the other across the western.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The steep valley walls seem to have been incorporated into the city’s defensive wall system in all periods. The only side of the city lacking in natural defense was that on the N, and here the walls were made especially strong. When attacking the city in 70 C.E., General Titus, according to Josephus, was faced with three successive walls on that side.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Water Supply.</strong> Jerusalem’s inhabitants suffered from serious food shortages in siege, but evidently had no great water problem. For, in spite of its nearness to the arid Judean Wilderness, the city had access to a constant supply of fresh water and had adequate storage facilities within the city walls.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Two springs, En-rogel and Gihon, were located near the city. The first lay a little S of the junction of the Kidron and Hinnom valleys. While a valuable source of water, its position made it inaccessible during times of attack or siege. The Gihon spring lay on the W side of the Kidron Valley, alongside what came to be called the City of David. Though outside the city walls, it was close enough that a tunnel could be excavated connecting to a shaft, enabling the city’s inhabitants to draw water without going outside the protective walls. This was done early in the city’s history, according to the archaeological evidence. In 1961 and 1962, excavations revealed a substantial early wall, situated <em>below</em> the upper end, or entrance, of the tunnel, hence enclosing it. It is thought to be the wall of the old Jebusite city.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Over the years, additional tunnels and canals were formed to channel Gihon’s waters. One channel ran from the mouth of the cave of the Gihon spring down the valley and around the end of the SE hill to a pool located at the junction of the Hinnom Valley with the central or Tyropoeon Valley. According to what has been found, it was in the form of a trench, covered with flat stones, and tunneled through the hillside at points. Openings at intervals allowed for water to be drawn off for irrigation of the valley terraces below. The canal’s gradient of about 4 or 5 millimeters per meter (less than 0.2 in. per yd) produced a slow gentle flow, reminding one of “the waters of the Shiloah that are going gently.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/11/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 8:6</a>) It is suggested that this canal, unprotected and vulnerable, was constructed during Solomon’s reign, when peace and security were predominant.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jerusalem’s homes and buildings were evidently equipped with underground cisterns, supplementing the supply of water from springs. Rainwater collected from the roofs was stored therein, kept clean and cool. The temple area seems to have had particularly large cisterns, archaeologists claiming to have plotted 37 cisterns there with a total capacity of about 38,000 kl (10,000,000 gal), one cistern alone estimated as capable of holding 7,600 kl (2,000,000 gal).</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Over the centuries a number of aqueducts, or conduits, were built, in order to provide water for Jerusalem. Tradition ascribes to Solomon the construction of a conduit from the “Pools of Solomon” (three reservoirs SW of Bethlehem) to the temple enclosure at Jerusalem. At <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ecclesiastes 2:6</a>, Solomon says: “I made pools of water for myself, to irrigate with them the forest.” Such a large undertaking as the building of the pools could well have included the building of a conduit for the larger supply of water that would be needed at Jerusalem after the temple services were instituted. However, there is no evidence, other than tradition, to support the Solomonic origin of a conduit from the Pools of Solomon to Jerusalem. A number of aqueducts can still be traced. One conduit constructed to carry water from springs in the Wadi el-ʽArrub 20 km (12 mi) SSW of Jerusalem to the Pools of Solomon is possibly the one alluded to by Josephus, who says that it was constructed by Pontius Pilate with temple treasury funds. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XVIII, 60 [iii, 2]; <em>The Jewish War,</em> II, 175 [ix, 4]) Of the two aqueducts leading from the Pools of Solomon to Jerusalem, the lower one is the older, possibly dating from the time of Herod or of the Hasmonaeans. This aqueduct passed under the village of Bethlehem and ran on to the Temple Mount over “Wilson’s Arch.”</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Archaeological Research.</strong> Though much research and excavation have been carried out, few concrete facts have been determined as to the city of Bible times. Various factors have restricted investigation or limited its value. Jerusalem has had almost continuous occupation in the Common Era, thus severely reducing the area available for excavation. <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>Then, too, the city was destroyed a number of times, with new cities built on top of the ruins and often made, in part, from material of those ruins. The piling up of debris and rubble, in some places about 30 m (100 ft) deep, has obscured the early contours of the site and made the interpretation of the excavated evidence a precarious task. Some wall sections, pools, water tunnels, and ancient tombs have been unearthed, but very little written material. Principal archaeological discoveries have come from the SE hill, which now lies outside the city walls.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The main sources of information regarding the ancient city, therefore, remain the Bible and the description of the first-century city given by Jewish historian Josephus.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Early History.</strong> The first historical mention of the city comes in the decade between 1943 and 1933 B.C.E., when Abraham’s encounter with Melchizedek took place. Melchizedek was “king of Salem” and “priest of the Most High God.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 14:17-20</a>) However, the origins of the city and of the population that composed it are as wrapped in obscurity as is the origin of its king-priest Melchizedek.​—Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heb 7:1-3</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Apparently another event in Abraham’s life involved the vicinity of Jerusalem. Abraham was commanded to offer up his son Isaac on “one of the mountains” in “the land of Moriah.” The temple built by Solomon was erected on “Mount Moriah” on a site that previously had been a threshing floor. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/15/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 22:2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/15/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2Ch 3:1</a>) Thus, the Bible apparently links the place of Abraham’s attempted sacrifice with the mountainous region around Jerusalem. (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MORIAH</a>.) Whether Melchizedek was still living then is not revealed; but Salem likely remained friendly territory for Abraham.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The Amarna Tablets, written by Canaanite rulers to their Egyptian overlord, include seven letters from the king or governor of Jerusalem (Urusalim). These letters were written prior to the Israelite conquest of Canaan. Thus, Jerusalem, in the approximately 465-year period between Abraham’s meeting with Melchizedek and the Israelite conquest, had become the possession of pagan Hamitic Canaanites and was under the domination of the Hamitic Egyptian Empire.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The account of Joshua’s sweeping conquest of Canaan lists Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, among the confederate kings attacking Gibeon. His name (meaning “(My) Lord Is Righteousness”) closely parallels that of Jerusalem’s earlier King Melchizedek (“King of Righteousness”), but Adoni-zedek was no worshiper of the Most High God, Jehovah.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 10:1-5,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 23,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 26;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12:7, 8,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/16/4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 10</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In the allotting of tribal territories, Jerusalem was on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin, the specific border running along the Valley of Hinnom. This would place at least what comprised the later “City of David,” situated on the ridge between the Kidron and Tyropoeon valleys, within the territory of Benjamin. Apparently the Canaanite city had additional settlements, or “suburbs,” however, and part of the settled area may have overlapped into Judah’s territory to the W and S of the Valley of Hinnom. Judah is credited with the initial capture of Jerusalem at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Judges 1:8</a>, but after the invading forces moved on, the Jebusite inhabitants apparently remained (or returned) in sufficient force to form a later pocket of resistance that neither Judah nor Benjamin could break. Thus, of both Judah and Benjamin it is said that the ‘Jebusites continued dwelling with them in Jerusalem.’ (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/18/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 15:63;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/18/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Jg 1:21</a>) This situation continued for some four centuries, and the city was at times referred to as “Jebus,” “a city of foreigners.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 19:10-12;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/19/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1Ch 11:4, 5</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>During the United Kingdom.</strong> King Saul’s headquarters were at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin. King David’s capital city was first at Hebron in Judah, about 30 km (19 mi) SSW of Jerusalem. After ruling there a total of seven and a half years (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:5</a>), he determined to transfer the capital to Jerusalem. This was by divine direction (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/21/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ch 6:4-6</a>), Jehovah having spoken centuries earlier of the ‘site where He would choose to place his name.’​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/22/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 12:5;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/22/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 26:2</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/23/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ch 7:12</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">It seems that the Jebusites at that time had their city on the southern end of the eastern spur. They were confident of the impregnability of their fortress city, with its natural defenses of steep valley walls on three sides and, probably, special fortifications on the north. It was known as “the place difficult to approach” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/24/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ch 11:7</a>), and the Jebusites taunted David that even ‘the blind and the lame of the city’ could hold off his attacks. But David conquered the city, his attack being spearheaded by Joab, who evidently gained entry into the city by means of “the water tunnel.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/25/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:6-9;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/25/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1Ch 11:4-8</a>) Scholars are not entirely certain of the meaning of the Hebrew term here rendered “water tunnel,” but generally accept this or similar terms (“water shaft,” <em>RS, AT;</em> “gutter,” <em>JP</em>) as the most likely meaning. The brief account does not state just how the city’s defenses were breached. Since the discovery of the tunnel and shaft leading to the Gihon spring, the popular view is that Joab led men up this vertical shaft, through the sloping tunnel and into the city in a surprise attack. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 951) By whatever means, the city was taken and David <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>moved his capital there (1070 B.C.E.). The Jebusite stronghold now came to be known as “the City of David,” also called “Zion.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/26/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:7</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">David began a building program within the area, apparently also improving the city’s defenses. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/27/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:9-11;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/27/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 1Ch 11:8</a>) “The Mound” (Heb., <em>ham·Mil·lohʼʹ</em>) referred to here (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/28/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:9</a>) and in later accounts (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/29/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 9:15,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/29/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 24;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/29/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 11:27</a>) was some geographic or structural feature of the city, well known then but unidentifiable today. When David later transferred the sacred “ark of Jehovah” from the house of Obed-edom to Jerusalem, the city became the religious, as well as administrative, center of the nation.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/30/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 6:11, 12,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/30/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 17</a>; see <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BURIAL, BURIAL PLACES</a>; <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DAVID, CITY OF</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MOUND</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">There is no record of Jerusalem’s being attacked by enemy forces during David’s reign, as he carried the battle to his foes. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/31/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 5:17-25;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/31/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 8:1-14;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/31/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 11:1</a>.) On one occasion, however, David saw fit to abandon the city before the advance of rebel forces led by his own son, Absalom. The king’s retreat may have been to avoid having blood shed in civil war at this place where Jehovah’s name rested.

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Hellenic and Maccabean Control.</strong> The changeover from Medo-Persian to Greek control came in 332 B.C.E. when Alexander the Great marched through Judah. The Greek historians make no mention of Alexander’s entry into Jerusalem. Yet the city did come under Greek dominion, and it is reasonable to assume that it was not completely bypassed by Alexander. Josephus, in the first century C.E., records the Jewish tradition that, upon approaching Jerusalem, Alexander was met by the Jewish high priest and was shown the divinely inspired prophecies recorded by Daniel foretelling the lightning conquests by Greece. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XI, 326-338 [viii, 4, 5]; <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/86/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Da 8:5-7,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/86/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 20, 21</a>) Whatever the case, Jerusalem seems to have survived the change in control free of any damage.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Following Alexander’s death, Jerusalem and Judea came under the control of the Ptolemies, who ruled out of Egypt. In 198 B.C.E. Antiochus the Great, ruling in Syria, after taking the fortified city of Sidon, captured Jerusalem, and Judea became a dominion of the Seleucid Empire. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/87/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Da 11:16</a>.) Jerusalem lay under Seleucid rule for 30 years. Then, in the year 168 B.C.E., Syrian King Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), in his attempt to Hellenize completely the Jews, dedicated Jerusalem’s temple to Zeus (Jupiter) and profaned the altar by an unclean sacrifice. (1 Maccabees 1:57, 62; 2 Maccabees 6:1, 2, 5; PICTURES, Vol. 2, p. 335) This led to the Maccabean (or Hasmonaean) revolt. After a three-year struggle, Judas Maccabaeus gained control of the city and temple and <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>rededicated Jehovah’s altar to true worship on the anniversary of its profanation, Chislev 25, 165 B.C.E.​—1 Maccabees 4:52-54; 2 Maccabees 10:5; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/88/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 10:22</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The war against the Seleucid rulers had not ended. The Jews appealed to Rome for help and thus a new power came on the Jerusalem scene in about 160 B.C.E. (1 Maccabees 8:17, 18) Now Jerusalem began to come under the influence of the expanding Roman Empire. About 142 B.C.E., Simon Maccabaeus was able to make Jerusalem the capital of a region ostensibly free from subservience to or taxation by Gentile nations. Aristobulus I, Jerusalem’s high priest, even assumed the title of king in 104 B.C.E. He was not, however, of the Davidic line.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jerusalem was no ‘city of peace’ during this period. Internal quarrels, fired by selfish ambitions and worsened by rival religious factions​—Sadducees, Pharisees, Zealots, and others—​gravely weakened the city. A violent quarrel between Aristobulus II and his brother Hyrcanus resulted in Rome’s being called on to arbitrate the dispute. Under General Pompey, Roman forces besieged Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. for three months in order to enter the city and settle the dispute. Twelve thousand Jews reportedly died, many at the hands of fellow Israelites.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">It is in Josephus’ account of Pompey’s conquest that the archway across the Tyropoeon Valley is first mentioned. It served as a link between the eastern and western halves of the city and gave those on the western half direct access to the temple area.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The Idumean Antipater (II) was now installed as Roman governor for Judea, a Maccabean being left as high priest and local ethnarch in Jerusalem. Later, Antipater’s son Herod (the Great) was appointed by Rome as “king” over Judea. He did not get control of Jerusalem until 37 or 36 B.C.E., from which date his rule effectively began.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Under Herod the Great.</strong> Herod’s rule was marked by an ambitious building program, and the city enjoyed considerable prosperity. A theater, gymnasium, and hippodrome (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 535), as well as other public buildings, were added. Herod also built a well-fortified royal palace (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 538), evidently on the W side of the city S of the present-day Jaffa Gate, where archaeologists believe they have found the foundation of one of the towers. Another fortress, the Tower of Antonia, lay near the temple and was connected with it by a passageway. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 535; <em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XV, 424 [xi, 7]) The Roman garrison could thus gain quick access to the temple area, as likely occurred when soldiers rescued Paul from a mob there.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/89/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ac 21:31, 32</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Herod’s greatest work, however, was the reconstruction of the temple and its building complex. Beginning in his 18th year (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XV, 380 [xi, 1]), the holy house itself was completed in a year and a half, but the work on the adjoining buildings and courtyards went on long after his death. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/90/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 2:20</a>) The total area encompassed was about double that of the previous temple area. Part of the wall of the temple courtyard apparently still stands, known today as the Western Wall, or the Wailing Wall. Archaeologists date the lower courses of huge 0.9-m-high (3 ft) blocks as from Herod’s construction.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>From 2 B.C.E. to 70 C.E.</strong> The Christian Greek Scriptures now carry forward the description of events involving Jerusalem. Jesus’ birth took place, not at Jerusalem, but at nearby Bethlehem, “David’s city.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/91/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 2:10, 11</a>) Nevertheless, the astrologers’ later report about the birth of the “king of the Jews” caused Herod and “all Jerusalem along with him” to become agitated. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/92/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 2:1-3</a>) Shortly after issuing his infamous decree ordering the killing of Bethlehem’s babes, Herod died, evidently in the year 1 B.C.E. (See <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/11\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HEROD</a> No. 1.) His son Archelaus inherited rulership over Jerusalem and Judea as well as other areas. Rome later removed Archelaus for misdemeanors; thereafter governors who were directly appointed by Rome ruled, as did Pontius Pilate during Jesus’ ministry.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/93/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 3:1</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jesus was taken to Jerusalem 40 days after birth and presented at the temple as Mary’s firstborn. Aged Simeon and Anna rejoiced at seeing the promised Messiah, and Anna spoke of him “to all those waiting for Jerusalem’s deliverance.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/94/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 2:21-38</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/95/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Le 12:2-4</a>.) How many other times he was taken to Jerusalem during his childhood years is not stated, only one visit, made when he was 12, being specifically recorded. He then engaged in a discussion with teachers in the temple area, thus being occupied in the ‘house of his Father,’ in the chosen city of his Father.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/96/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 2:41-49</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">After his baptism and during his three-and-a-half-year ministry Jesus periodically visited Jerusalem; he certainly was there for the three annual festivals, attendance at which was obligatory for all Jewish males.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Aside from the temple area, where Jesus frequently taught, few other specific points in the <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>city are mentioned in connection with his ministry. The Pool of Bethzatha with its five colonnades (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/98/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 5:2</a>) is thought to be the one that was unearthed just N of the temple area.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Six days prior to the Passover festival of 33 C.E., Jesus came to Bethany, on the eastern side of the Mount of Olives. The next day, Nisan 9, as Jehovah’s anointed King, he approached the capital city, mounted on the colt of an ass, in fulfillment of the prophecy of <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/100/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zechariah 9:9</a>.

With thousands bearing witness to their faith, it is no wonder the angry religious leaders cried: “Look! you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/118/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ac 5:28</a>) Miracles performed added power to the testimony, as, for example, the healing of the lame beggar at “the temple door that was called Beautiful,” likely the E gate of the Court of Women.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/119/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ac 3:2,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/119/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 6, 7</a>.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">Jesus had called Jerusalem “the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent forth to her.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/127/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 23:37</a>; compare vss <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/128/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">34-36</a>.) Though many of her citizens showed faith in God’s Son, the city as a whole continued to follow the pattern of the past. For this, ‘her house was abandoned to her.’ (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/129/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 23:38</a>) In 66 C.E. a Jewish revolt brought Roman forces under Cestius Gallus to the city, surrounding it and making a thrust right up to the temple walls. Suddenly Cestius Gallus withdrew for no apparent reason. This allowed Christians to put into action Jesus’ instructions: “Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains, and let those in the midst of [Jerusalem] withdraw, and let those in the country places not enter into her.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/130/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 21:20-22</a>) Eusebius, in his <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> (III, V, 3), states that the Christians fled from Jerusalem and the whole land of Judea to a city of Perea that was called Pella.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Jerusalem’s relief as a result of the Roman withdrawal was short-lived, as it had been when the Babylonians temporarily withdrew to deal with the Egyptians near the end of King Zedekiah’s reign. Under General Titus the Roman forces returned in 70 C.E. in increased numbers and laid siege to the city, now crowded with Passover celebrants. Siege banks were thrown up by the Romans, and a continuous wall or fence was erected around the entire city to prevent escape by day or night. This, too, fulfilled Jesus’ prophecy. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/131/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 19:43</a>) Within the city rival factions quarreled and fought, much of the food supply was destroyed, and those caught attempting to leave the city were slain as traitors. Josephus, the source of this information, relates that in time the famine became so grave that the people were reduced to eating wisps of hay and leather, even their own children. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/132/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">La 2:11, 12,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/132/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 19, 20;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/132/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> De 28:56, 57</a>.) Titus’ offers of peace were consistently rejected by the stubborn city leaders.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Eventually the walls were systematically breached by the Romans, and their troops invaded the city. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 752) Despite orders to the contrary, the temple was burned and gutted. According to Josephus, this took place on the anniversary of Nebuchadnezzar’s destruction of the first temple centuries earlier. His account also states that the repository of the archives, housing the genealogical records of tribal and family descent and inheritance rights, was put to the fire. (<em>The Jewish War,</em> VI, 250, 251 [iv, 5]; II, 426-428 [xvii, 6]; VI, 354 [vi, 3]) Thus, the legal means for establishing the lineage of members of the Messianic tribe of Judah and the priestly tribe of Levi came to an end.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In just 4 months and 25 days, from April 3 to August 30, 70 C.E., the conquest had been effected. Thus, the tribulation, though intense, was remarkably short. The unreasoning attitude and actions of the Jews within the city doubtless <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>contributed to this shortness. Though Josephus puts the number of dead at 1,100,000, there were survivors. Ninety-seven thousand captives were taken, many of whom were sent as slaves to Egypt or were killed by sword or beasts in the theaters of the Roman provinces. This, too, fulfilled divine prophecy.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/133/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 28:68</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The entire city was demolished, with only the towers of Herod’s palace and a portion of the western wall left standing as evidence to later generations of the defensive strength that had availed nothing. Josephus remarks that, apart from these remnants, “the rest of the wall encompassing the city was so completely levelled to the ground as to leave future visitors to the spot no ground for believing that it had ever been inhabited.” (<em>The Jewish War,</em> VII, 3 [i, 1]) A relief on the Arch of Titus in Rome depicts Roman soldiers carrying off sacred vessels of the ruined temple.​—Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/134/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 24:2</a>; PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 752.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Later Periods.</strong> Jerusalem remained virtually desolate until about 130 C.E., when Emperor Hadrian ordered the building of a new city, named Aelia Capitolina. This provoked a Jewish revolt by Bar Kokhba (132-135 C.E.), which succeeded for a time but was then crushed. Jews were not allowed in the Roman-built city for nearly two centuries. In the fourth century, Constantine the Great’s mother Helena visited Jerusalem and began the identification of the many so-called holy sites and shrines. Later the Muslims captured the city. Today there are two Islamic structures on the Temple Mount. Late in the seventh century Caliph ʽAbd al-Malik ibn Marwan built the Dome of the Rock on or near the temple site. Although also called a mosque, it is in reality a shrine. South of the Dome of the Rock is the el-Aqsa mosque, first constructed in the eighth century, but largely rebuilt in the eleventh century.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>The City’s Significance.</strong> Jerusalem was far more than the capital of an earthly nation. It was the only city in all the earth upon which Jehovah God placed his name. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/135/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 11:36</a>) After the ark of the covenant, associated with God’s presence, was transferred there, and even more so when the temple sanctuary, or house of God, was constructed there, Jerusalem became Jehovah’s figurative ‘residence,’ his “resting-place.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/136/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ps 78:68, 69;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/136/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 132:13, 14;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/136/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 135:21</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/137/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Sa 7:1-7,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/137/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12, 13</a>.)

                "<p class=\"sb\">Jerusalem therefore represented the seat of the divinely constituted government or typical kingdom of God. From it went forth God’s law, his word, and his blessing.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Since Jehovah’s praise and his will are effected primarily by his intelligent creatures, it was not <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>the buildings forming the city that determined his continued use of the city but the people in it, rulers and ruled, priests and people.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Yet the name Jerusalem continued to be used as symbolic of something greater than the earthly city. The apostle Paul, by divine inspiration, revealed that there is a “Jerusalem above,” which he speaks of as the “mother” of anointed Christians.

Thereafter irrigation creates a luxuriant oasis some 16 km (10 mi) wide and 48 km (30 mi) long. This abundant water supply made Damascus a key point on the ancient military and trade routes between the lands of the eastern Mediterranean, the countries of Mesopotamia, and the Orient. Also serving to channel traffic by Damascus are the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges, since these act as a natural barrier to caravan traffic moving toward or from the Mediterranean seaboard.</p>",

East of the Anti-Lebanon range, a route went S from Damascus to Hazor and N to Hamath, Aleppo, and Carchemish.

These were the roads over which marched the armies of Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, and Persia. In yet another direction, caravans heading for Mesopotamia first went from Damascus E to Tadmor and from there to the Euphrates region.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The plain on which Damascus is situated is a plateau region some 700 m (2,300 ft) above sea level, and the city enjoys a pleasant climate, with average temperatures varying from about 7° C. (45° F.) in winter to 29° C. (84° F.) in summer. The very fertile land produces fine orchards of olives, figs, and apricots, as well as rich grainfields. The city’s prosperity, however, came primarily from the commercial traffic and also because it was a natural trading center for nomadic tribes. Damascus is called a “merchant” of Tyre by the prophet Ezekiel, evidently trading wine from the neighboring city of Helbon and reddish-gray wool in exchange for Tyre’s exports of manufactured articles.

                "<p class=\"sb\">An ancient and important city of Syria. Damascus (present-day esh-Sham, or Dimashq) lies at the foot of the Anti-Lebanon Range, with the nearby Arabian-Syrian Desert stretching out before it to the E. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001114/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ca 7:4</a>) To the SW of the city, snowcapped Mount Hermon rises 2,814 m (9,232 ft), marking the southern end of the Anti-Lebanon Range.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The slopes behind Damascus to the W are quite barren, but the cool waters of the Barada River (the Abanah of <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001114/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2Ki 5:12</a>) come rushing through a gorge in the mountains and flow onto the plain where the city is situated. Thereafter irrigation creates a luxuriant oasis some 16 km (10 mi) wide and 48 km (30 mi) long. This abundant water supply made Damascus a key point on the ancient military and trade routes between the lands of the eastern Mediterranean, the countries of Mesopotamia, and the Orient. Also serving to channel traffic by Damascus are the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges, since these act as a natural barrier to caravan traffic moving toward or from the Mediterranean seaboard.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Northwest of the city there is a break in the Anti-Lebanon range, and from ancient times, this pass connected to the major highway through Coele-Syria (the Beqaʽ) that went S to Hazor, then down along the W side of the Sea of Galilee through the Plains of Megiddo toward the seacoast, and continued S through Philistia and on to Egypt. East of the Anti-Lebanon range, a route went S from Damascus to Hazor and N to Hamath, Aleppo, and Carchemish. Another prominent route, commonly called the King’s Highway (compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001114/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nu 21:22</a>), ran S from Damascus, following the edge of the plateau E of the Jordan on down to the Red Sea and the Arabian Peninsula. These were the roads over which marched the armies of Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, and Persia. In yet another direction, caravans heading for Mesopotamia first went from Damascus E to Tadmor and from there to the Euphrates region.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The plain on which Damascus is situated is a plateau region some 700 m (2,300 ft) above sea level, and the city enjoys a pleasant climate, with average temperatures varying from about 7° C. (45° F.) in winter to 29° C. (84° F.) in summer. The very fertile land produces fine orchards of olives, figs, and apricots, as well as rich grainfields. The city’s prosperity, however, came primarily from the commercial traffic and also because it was a natural trading center for nomadic tribes. Damascus is called a “merchant” of Tyre by the prophet Ezekiel, evidently trading wine from the neighboring city of Helbon and reddish-gray wool in exchange for Tyre’s exports of manufactured articles.

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>History.</strong> The initial history of Damascus is unknown. Josephus (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> I, 145 [vi, 4]) presents the traditional Jewish view that it was founded by Uz, the son of Aram and grandson of Shem, though there are indications of a more southerly position for the descendants of Uz.

David defeated them as well, stationed garrisons in the Damascene kingdom, and made Damascus tributary to Israel.

                "<p class=\"sb\">A league or confederation of ten cities (from Greek <em>deʹka,</em> meaning “ten,” and <em>poʹlis,</em> “city”). The name also applied to the region in which most of these cities were centered.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 4:25</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Following the conquest by Alexander the Great in about 332 B.C.E., Greek colonies developed in Syria and Palestine, apparently settled by veterans from Alexander’s armies who were thereafter followed by Greek-speaking immigrants. In many cases these colonies grew on the sites of earlier Jewish towns, while in others they were built on fresh sites, particularly E of the Jordan River. They flourished during the rule of the Seleucids of Syria and the Ptolemies of Egypt, but the rise of the Maccabean-Jewish state (starting c. 168 B.C.E.) greatly jeopardized their relatively independent position. While the populations of these cities doubtless included many Jews, still these cities were centers of Greek culture and organization and hence were very much out of step with the Maccabean aims. When Pompey conquered and reorganized Palestine in 63 B.C.E., these Hellenistic cities were given Roman protection and a favored status. They were allowed to mint their own coins and, to a great extent, to exercise self-government, although they still owed allegiance to Rome and to the Syrian provincial government and were required to pay taxes and provide men for military service.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Formation of the League.</strong> Likely sometime between Pompey’s conquest and the death of Herod the Great (c. 1 B.C.E.) ten of these Hellenistic cities formed themselves into the loose federation known as the Decapolis. The motive underlying this union seems to have been a mutual interest in close trade relations and also defense against either anti-Hellenistic forces within Palestine or aggressive nomadic tribes in the desert regions to the E. The term “Decapolis” first appears in the Christian Greek Scriptures and in the writings of Josephus and Pliny the Elder (both of the first century C.E.). Pliny, while acknowledging that some difference of opinion already existed, listed the following cities as among the original ten: Damascus, Philadelphia, Raphana, Scythopolis, Gadara, Hippo (Hippos), Dion, Pella, Galasa <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>(Gerasa), and Canatha. (<em>Natural History,</em> V, XVI, 74) Of these, only Scythopolis (Beth-shean) lay W of the Jordan; because of the strategic position of the Valley of Esdraelon (Jezreel), it served as an important link with the Mediterranean Coast and seaports. Damascus, far to the N in Syria, was evidently included because of its importance as a trade center. Philadelphia (ancient Rabbah, modern ʽAmman) was the southernmost of the ten cities, only about 40 km (25 mi) NE of the northern end of the Dead Sea. The remainder of the cities were in the fertile region of Gilead or neighboring Bashan. Most of them are believed to have been on or near the main roads of that region. Canatha is likely the Kenath of <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Numbers 32:42</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In the second century C.E., Ptolemy names 18 cities as in the “Decapolis,” which may indicate that the name came to be used in a general way and that the number of cities varied. Some scholars would put Abila, listed by Ptolemy, in place of Raphana as among the original ten. It seems evident, at any rate, that the Decapolis region did not have precisely defined boundaries and that the authority of the cities of the Decapolis did not embrace all the intervening territory but applied only within the district of each particular city.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Jesus’ Ministry and the Decapolis.</strong> While people from the Decapolis were among the crowds that flocked to hear Jesus’ teaching in Galilee (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 4:25</a>), there is no specific mention of his having devoted time to any of its Hellenistic cities. Jesus did enter the region of Decapolis during his Galilean ministry when he crossed the Sea of Galilee and entered the country of the Gerasenes (or Gadarenes according to <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 8:28</a>).

                "<p class=\"sb\">By no means alone among the cities of Palestine in their Hellenistic leanings, the cities of the Decapolis reflected the most powerful expression of Greek influence. They are believed to have reached their peak during the second century C.E., and in the following century the league began to break up. Evidence of the strong Greek influence, as well as the wealth of the Decapolitan cities, can be seen in the impressive remains of theaters, amphitheaters, temples, baths, aqueducts, and other structures at Gerasa (modern Jarash) as well as at other cities.</p>",

Thereafter irrigation creates a luxuriant oasis some 16 km (10 mi) wide and 48 km (30 mi) long. This abundant water supply made Damascus a key point on the ancient military and trade routes between the lands of the eastern Mediterranean, the countries of Mesopotamia, and the Orient. Also serving to channel traffic by Damascus are the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges, since these act as a natural barrier to caravan traffic moving toward or from the Mediterranean seaboard.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Northwest of the city there is a break in the Anti-Lebanon range, and from ancient times, this pass connected to the major highway through Coele-Syria (the Beqaʽ) that went S to Hazor, then down along the W side of the Sea of Galilee through the Plains of Megiddo toward the seacoast, and continued S through Philistia and on to Egypt. East of the Anti-Lebanon range, a route went S from Damascus to Hazor and N to Hamath, Aleppo, and Carchemish. Another prominent route, commonly called the King’s Highway (compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001114/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nu 21:22</a>), ran S from Damascus, following the edge of the plateau E of the Jordan on down to the Red Sea and the Arabian Peninsula. These were the roads over which marched the armies of Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, and Persia. In yet another direction, caravans heading for Mesopotamia first went from Damascus E to Tadmor and from there to the Euphrates region.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The plain on which Damascus is situated is a plateau region some 700 m (2,300 ft) above sea level, and the city enjoys a pleasant climate, with average temperatures varying from about 7° C. (45° F.) in winter to 29° C. (84° F.) in summer. The very fertile land produces fine orchards of olives, figs, and apricots, as well as rich grainfields. The city’s prosperity, however, came primarily from the commercial traffic and also because it was a natural trading center for nomadic tribes. Damascus is called a “merchant” of Tyre by the prophet Ezekiel, evidently trading wine from the neighboring city of Helbon and reddish-gray wool in exchange for Tyre’s exports of manufactured articles.

As a key junction point on the main route from Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean, Damascus was a principal target. At the head of a coalition of neighboring kingdoms, Damascus resisted with some success a series of attacks by Shalmaneser III of Assyria.

                "<p class=\"sb\">A league or confederation of ten cities (from Greek <em>deʹka,</em> meaning “ten,” and <em>poʹlis,</em> “city”). The name also applied to the region in which most of these cities were centered.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 4:25</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Following the conquest by Alexander the Great in about 332 B.C.E., Greek colonies developed in Syria and Palestine, apparently settled by veterans from Alexander’s armies who were thereafter followed by Greek-speaking immigrants. In many cases these colonies grew on the sites of earlier Jewish towns, while in others they were built on fresh sites, particularly E of the Jordan River. They flourished during the rule of the Seleucids of Syria and the Ptolemies of Egypt, but the rise of the Maccabean-Jewish state (starting c. 168 B.C.E.) greatly jeopardized their relatively independent position. While the populations of these cities doubtless included many Jews, still these cities were centers of Greek culture and organization and hence were very much out of step with the Maccabean aims. When Pompey conquered and reorganized Palestine in 63 B.C.E., these Hellenistic cities were given Roman protection and a favored status. They were allowed to mint their own coins and, to a great extent, to exercise self-government, although they still owed allegiance to Rome and to the Syrian provincial government and were required to pay taxes and provide men for military service.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Formation of the League.</strong> Likely sometime between Pompey’s conquest and the death of Herod the Great (c. 1 B.C.E.) ten of these Hellenistic cities formed themselves into the loose federation known as the Decapolis. The motive underlying this union seems to have been a mutual interest in close trade relations and also defense against either anti-Hellenistic forces within Palestine or aggressive nomadic tribes in the desert regions to the E. The term “Decapolis” first appears in the Christian Greek Scriptures and in the writings of Josephus and Pliny the Elder (both of the first century C.E.). Pliny, while acknowledging that some difference of opinion already existed, listed the following cities as among the original ten: Damascus, Philadelphia, Raphana, Scythopolis, Gadara, Hippo (Hippos), Dion, Pella, Galasa <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>(Gerasa), and Canatha. (<em>Natural History,</em> V, XVI, 74) Of these, only Scythopolis (Beth-shean) lay W of the Jordan; because of the strategic position of the Valley of Esdraelon (Jezreel), it served as an important link with the Mediterranean Coast and seaports. Damascus, far to the N in Syria, was evidently included because of its importance as a trade center. Philadelphia (ancient Rabbah, modern ʽAmman) was the southernmost of the ten cities, only about 40 km (25 mi) NE of the northern end of the Dead Sea. The remainder of the cities were in the fertile region of Gilead or neighboring Bashan. Most of them are believed to have been on or near the main roads of that region. Canatha is likely the Kenath of <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Numbers 32:42</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In the second century C.E., Ptolemy names 18 cities as in the “Decapolis,” which may indicate that the name came to be used in a general way and that the number of cities varied. Some scholars would put Abila, listed by Ptolemy, in place of Raphana as among the original ten. It seems evident, at any rate, that the Decapolis region did not have precisely defined boundaries and that the authority of the cities of the Decapolis did not embrace all the intervening territory but applied only within the district of each particular city.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Jesus’ Ministry and the Decapolis.</strong> While people from the Decapolis were among the crowds that flocked to hear Jesus’ teaching in Galilee (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 4:25</a>), there is no specific mention of his having devoted time to any of its Hellenistic cities. Jesus did enter the region of Decapolis during his Galilean ministry when he crossed the Sea of Galilee and entered the country of the Gerasenes (or Gadarenes according to <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 8:28</a>).

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Later History.</strong> According to Eusebius, prior to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E., Christians of Judea fled to the Decapolitan city of Pella in the mountainous region of Gilead, thereby giving heed to Jesus’ prophetic warning.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 21:20, 21</a>; <em>The Ecclesiastical History,</em> III, V, 3.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">By no means alone among the cities of Palestine in their Hellenistic leanings, the cities of the Decapolis reflected the most powerful expression of Greek influence. They are believed to have reached their peak during the second century C.E., and in the following century the league began to break up. Evidence of the strong Greek influence, as well as the wealth of the Decapolitan cities, can be seen in the impressive remains of theaters, amphitheaters, temples, baths, aqueducts, and other structures at Gerasa (modern Jarash) as well as at other cities.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">Hermon has been identified with the highest mountain in the vicinity of Palestine, called Jebel esh-Sheikh (possibly meaning “Mountain of the Old One”) or Jebel eth-Thalj (meaning <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>“Mountain of the Snow”) by the Arabs. These names evidently derive from the circumstance that Mount Hermon is snowcapped nearly the year around. Its snowy top might be said to resemble an old man’s crown of white hair. In ancient times, this mountain was known to the Sidonians as “Sirion” and to the Amorites as “Senir.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001999/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 3:8, 9</a>) The latter name also seems to have been used to denote a part of the Anti-Lebanon Range.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Forming the S end of the Anti-Lebanon Range, Mount Hermon rises 2,814 m (9,232 ft) above sea level and extends about 30 km (19 mi) from N to S. Its several peaks are connected by a plateau.

Its upper portion is completely bare with the exception of low shrubs in places. But lower down, there are firs, fruit trees, and shrubs. Vineyards occupy the lower slopes of the western and southern sides.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">On a clear day, the top of Hermon affords a splendid view of much of Palestine. To the W can be seen the mountains of Lebanon, the Plain of Tyre, and the Mediterranean Sea; to the SW, Mount Carmel; to the S, the Jordan Valley with the Hula Basin and the Sea of Galilee; and to the E, the Plain of Damascus.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Mount Hermon’s snowy head serves to condense the night vapors, thus producing abundant dew. “More copious dew,” observed the 19th-century naturalist H. B. Tristram, “we never experienced. Everything was drenched with it, and the tents were small protection.” (<em>The Land of Israel,</em> London, 1866, pp. 608, 609) The refreshing dew of Hermon preserves vegetation during the long rainless season.

Evidently Pharaoh Nechoh encamped at Riblah after defeating King Josiah, about 629 B.C.E. He was at that time marching N to fight against the Babylonians, who by then dominated Assyria.

                "<p class=\"sb\">As noted previously, Bethlehem was not listed among the cities of Judah in the accounts of the tribal divisions.

The Jewish people understood this prophecy to mean that the Messiah or Christ would be born in and proceed from that town (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000694/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 7:40-42</a>), a belief also expressed by their chief priests and scribes.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000694/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 2:3-6</a>.</p>",

The rainy season for Palestine begins about mid-October, lasting several months. By December, Bethlehem, like Jerusalem, experiences frequent frost at night. Thus the fact that shepherds of Bethlehem were in the fields at night points to a time prior to the start of the rainy season. It is also most unlikely that Caesar Augustus would unnecessarily provoke the Jews by ordering a registration in the wintry and rainy month of December, when traveling is particularly difficult.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000694/23/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 2:1-6</a>; compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000694/24/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 24:20</a>.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">In all the dealings the Tyrians had with Israel, there is no indication that, as a people, they were interested in the worship of Jehovah; their association was particularly a commercial one. Racially they were Canaanites, and religiously they practiced a form of Baal worship, their chief deities being Melkart and Astarte (Ashtoreth). When Ethbaal was king of the Sidonians (including Tyre), his daughter Jezebel married Ahab, the king of the northern kingdom of Israel. Jezebel was infamous in her determination to blot out the worship of Jehovah.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 16:29,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 31;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 18:4,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 13,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 19</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Condemned by God.</strong> It was not, however, for the personal wickedness of Jezebel and her daughter Athaliah that Tyre came under heavy divine condemnation. Tyre grew to be very great at the expense of other peoples, including Israel. She was a manufacturer of metal objects, <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>glassware, and purple dyes and was a trading center for the overland caravans as well as a great import-export depot. Along with this industrial and commercial growth came riches, conceit, and pride. Her merchants and tradesmen boasted of being princes and honorable ones of the earth.

                "<p class=\"sb\">In the latter part of the ninth century B.C.E., Jehovah took note of this city’s arrogant attitude. He therefore warned her that she would be paid back in kind for robbing his people of the gold, silver, and many other desirable things that she had used to beautify her temples. There was also to be an accounting for Tyre’s having sold God’s people into slavery.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joe 3:4-8;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/12/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Am 1:9, 10</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Later the prophet Isaiah recorded a further pronouncement against Tyre, which indicated that she would be forgotten for “seventy years.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 23:1-18</a>) Years thereafter the prophet Jeremiah included Tyre among those nations that were singled out to drink the wine of Jehovah’s rage.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Also through Ezekiel, a contemporary of Jeremiah, Jehovah pointed to calamity for Tyre at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 26:1–28:19</a>) Though Tyre had been compared to a pretty ship with multicolored sails and deck coverings and a prow inlaid with ivory, she would sink in the open sea.

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Destruction of City.</strong> In the course of Nebuchadnezzar’s long siege against Tyre, the heads of his soldiers were “made bald” from the chafing of their helmets, and their shoulders were “rubbed bare” from carrying materials used in the construction of siegeworks. Since Nebuchadnezzar received no “wages” for serving as His instrument in executing judgment upon Tyre, Jehovah promised to compensate him with the wealth of Egypt. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 29:17-20</a>) According to the Jewish historian Josephus, the siege lasted 13 years (<em>Against Apion,</em> I, 156 [21]), and it cost the Babylonians a great deal. Secular history does not record exactly how thorough or effective Nebuchadnezzar’s efforts were. But the loss in lives and property to the Tyrians must have been great.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 26:7-12</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">When the Israelites returned from Babylonian exile, however, the Tyrians were able to assist in supplying cedar timbers from Lebanon for a second temple, and they resumed their trade with the rebuilt city of Jerusalem.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/21/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ezr 3:7;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/21/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Ne 13:16</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Tyre’s conflict with Nebuchadnezzar, though great, was not to be the complete end for Tyre. A later prophetic pronouncement indicated that, though Tyre would build a rampart and pile up silver and gold, Jehovah himself would destroy her completely.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/22/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zec 9:3, 4</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Nearly 200 years after Zechariah’s prophecy was given, it was fulfilled. In 332 B.C.E. Alexander the Great marched his army across Asia Minor and, in his sweep southward, paused long enough to give his attention to Tyre. When the city refused to open its gates, Alexander in his rage had his army scrape up the ruins of the mainland city and throw it into the sea, thus building a causeway out to the island city, all of this in fulfillment of prophecy. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/23/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 26:4,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/23/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12</a>; DIAGRAM, Vol 2, p. 531) With his naval forces holding the Tyrian ships bottled up in their harbor, Alexander set about constructing the highest siege towers ever used in ancient wars. Finally, after seven months the 46-m-high (150 ft) walls were breached. In addition to the 8,000 military men killed in battle, 2,000 prominent leaders were killed as a reprisal, and 30,000 inhabitants were sold into slavery.</p>",

Since Dan is located at the base of the Anti-Lebanon mountains (and not far from Mount Hermon), this may mean that Moses’ view reached up to that range. The use of the name Dan here could correspond to its usage in the case of Abraham or could be the result of Joshua’s recording the final portion of the book, which includes events following Moses’ death.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Dan lay in “the low plain that belonged to Beth-rehob,” and this area, N of the waters of Merom and just below Lebanon, was a fertile and very desirable region, well watered.

The city was on a high mound near the southern foot of Mount Hermon and overlooked the spacious Hula Basin.

From its summit, a rather flat elliptic area about 0.4 km (0.25 mi) wide from N to S and twice as long from E to W, it affords a magnificent view in all directions.

These names evidently derive from the circumstance that Mount Hermon is snowcapped nearly the year around. Its snowy top might be said to resemble an old man’s crown of white hair. In ancient times, this mountain was known to the Sidonians as “Sirion” and to the Amorites as “Senir.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001999/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 3:8, 9</a>) The latter name also seems to have been used to denote a part of the Anti-Lebanon Range.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Forming the S end of the Anti-Lebanon Range, Mount Hermon rises 2,814 m (9,232 ft) above sea level and extends about 30 km (19 mi) from N to S. Its several peaks are connected by a plateau.

Its upper portion is completely bare with the exception of low shrubs in places. But lower down, there are firs, fruit trees, and shrubs. Vineyards occupy the lower slopes of the western and southern sides.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">On a clear day, the top of Hermon affords a splendid view of much of Palestine. To the W can be seen the mountains of Lebanon, the Plain of Tyre, and the Mediterranean Sea; to the SW, Mount Carmel; to the S, the Jordan Valley with the Hula Basin and the Sea of Galilee; and to the E, the Plain of Damascus.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Mount Hermon’s snowy head serves to condense the night vapors, thus producing abundant dew. “More copious dew,” observed the 19th-century naturalist H. B. Tristram, “we never experienced. Everything was drenched with it, and the tents were small protection.” (<em>The Land of Israel,</em> London, 1866, pp. 608, 609) The refreshing dew of Hermon preserves vegetation during the long rainless season.

Hearing of this, Sisera and his forces, equipped with 900 chariots having iron scythes, advance toward the Israelites along the dry bed of the Kishon (in the Plain of Jezreel). With Barak in the lead, the Israelite army, being only lightly equipped, courageously descends from Mount Tabor, ready for the fray with the fully armored Canaanites. However, the Kishon became an overwhelming torrent, immobilizing the enemy chariots. Indeed, “from heaven did the stars fight, from their orbits they fought against Sisera. The torrent of Kishon washed them away.” Barak and his men press their advantage, and the account states: “All the camp of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword.

                "<p class=\"sb\">After an indefinite period of time, Abel made an offering to Jehovah God. Cain did likewise.

(<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000018/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 4:3, 4</a>) They both had belief in God. They undoubtedly learned of Him from their parents and must have known why they all were outside the garden of Eden and denied entry to it. Their offerings indicated a recognition of their alienated state and of their desire for God’s favor. God expressed favor toward Abel’s offering but not Cain’s. How the approval and the rejection were manifested the record does not show, but it was undoubtedly evident to both men. The reason for God’s approval of only Abel’s offering is made clear by later writings. The apostle Paul lists Abel as the first man of faith, at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000018/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 11:4</a>, and shows that this resulted in his sacrifice being of “greater worth” than Cain’s offering.

(<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000018/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heb 11:4</a>) In the light of this, Abel’s offering of the firstlings of his flock certainly was appropriate and undoubtedly was a factor in God’s expression of approval. To the Giver of life, Abel gave as his gift life, even though it was only from among the flock.​—Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000018/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 1:36</a>.</p>",

His blood in effect cried to God for vengeance upon assassin Cain. The blood of Jesus, here presented as validating the new covenant, speaks in a better way than Abel’s in that it calls to God for mercy upon all persons of faith like Abel, and is the means by which their ransoming is possible.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Since Seth was evidently born shortly after Abel’s death and when Adam was 130 years of age, it is possible that Abel may have been as much as 100 years old at the time of his martyrdom.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000018/14/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ge 4:25;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000018/14/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 5:3</a>.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Location.</strong> Most scholars identify Nazareth with En Nasira (Nazerat) in Galilee. (PICTURES, Vol. 2, p. 539) If this view is correct, Nazareth was situated in the low mountains just N of the Valley of Jezreel and approximately halfway between the S tip of the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean Coast. It was in a mountain basin with hills rising 120 to 150 m (400 to 500 ft) above it. The area was well populated, with a number of cities and towns near Nazareth. Also, it is estimated that one could walk from Nazareth to Ptolemais on the Mediterranean Coast in seven hours, to Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee in five hours, and to Jerusalem in three days.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">On one occasion people of Nazareth sought to throw Jesus from “the brow of the mountain upon which their city had been built.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003190/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 4:29</a>) That is not to say that Nazareth was on the very brow or edge, but that it was on a mountain having a brow from which they wanted to hurl Jesus. Some have identified it with a rocky cliff some 12 m (40 ft) high located SW of the city.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Prominence of Nazareth.</strong> It is difficult to say with certainty just how prominent Nazareth was in the first century. The most common view of commentators is that Nazareth was then a rather secluded, insignificant village. The principal Biblical statement used to support this view is what Nathanael said when he heard that Jesus was from there: “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003190/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 1:46</a>) This has been taken by many to mean that Nazareth was looked down upon, even by people of Galilee.

It was not mentioned by Josephus, though he referred to nearby Japhia as the largest fortified village of all Galilee, leading to the idea that Nazareth was eclipsed by its neighbor.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">On the other hand, Nathanael may simply have been expressing surprise that Philip would claim a man from the neighborhood city of Nazareth in Galilee to be the promised Messiah, for the Scriptures had foretold that that one would come from Bethlehem in Judah. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003190/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mic 5:2</a>) Josephus did not mention many of the settlements in Galilee, so his not mentioning Nazareth might not be particularly significant. It is noteworthy that the Bible does not call Nazareth a village, but always a “city.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003190/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 1:26;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003190/7/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2:4,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003190/7/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 39</a>) Furthermore, close-by Sepphoris was an important, fortified city having a district <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>court of the Sanhedrin. Nonetheless, whatever its size and prominence, Nazareth was convenient to important trade routes and main cities, and so its inhabitants would have had ready information about the social, religious, and political activities of the time.​—Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003190/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 4:23</a>.</p>",

According to what is considered to be the best available manuscript evidence, Matthew originally used “country of the Gadarenes,” whereas Mark and Luke, in relating this event, employed “country of the Gerasenes.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 8:28;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/0/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Mr 5:1;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/0/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Lu 8:26</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Both countries are shown to lie on “the other side,” that is, the E side, of the Sea of Galilee. The designation “country of the Gadarenes” possibly applied to the district radiating from the city of Gadara (modern Umm Qeis), situated about 10 km (6 mi) SE of the Sea of Galilee. Coins of Gadara often depict a ship, suggesting that its territory may have extended as far as the Sea of Galilee and therefore could have included at least a part of “the country of the Gerasenes,” to the E of that body of water. Others link “the country of the Gerasenes” with the region around Kursi, the town that Origen and Eusebius identified as Gergesa. It is on the E coast of the Sea of Galilee, about 20 km (12 mi) N of Gadara. It best fits the geographical details of the account. Others link it with the large district centered at the city of Gerasa (Jarash) about 55 km (34 mi) SSE of the Sea of Galilee and suggest that it extended to the E of that lake and embraced “the country of the Gadarenes.” In any case, Matthew’s account would in no way conflict with that of Mark and Luke.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Near an unnamed city in the country of the Gadarenes, Jesus Christ met two unusually fierce demon-possessed men. These had their dwelling among the tombs, that is, rock-cut tombs or natural caves used as such. Jesus, in expelling the demons, permitted them to take possession of a large herd of swine that subsequently rushed over a precipice and drowned in the Sea of Galilee. This so disturbed the local inhabitants that they entreated Jesus to depart from the area.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 8:28-34</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">While Matthew mentions two men, <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mark (5:2</a>) and <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Luke (8:27</a>) center attention on only one, doubtless because his case was more outstanding. Possibly he was more violent and had suffered much longer under demon control than the other man; yet afterward perhaps he alone wanted to accompany the Son of God. Jesus did not allow him to do so, directing him instead to make known what God had done in his behalf.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">This differed from Jesus’ usual instructions not to have his miracles advertised. Instead of seeking showy publicity and having people reach conclusions on the basis of sensational reports, Jesus apparently wanted others to decide on solid evidence that he was indeed the Christ. This also fulfilled the prophetic words spoken through Isaiah: “He will not wrangle, nor cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the broad ways.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 12:15-21;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/4/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Isa 42:1-4</a>) However, the exception in the case of the former demoniac was appropriate. He could bear witness among people with whom the Son of God would have only limited contact, particularly in view of Jesus’ being requested to leave. The man’s presence would provide testimony about Jesus’ power to work good, counteracting any unfavorable report that might be circulated over the loss of the herd of swine.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mr 5:1-20;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/5/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Lu 8:26-39</a>; see <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SWINE</a>.</p>"

This leaves Tell Hum (Kefar Nahum), an extensive ruin about 4 km (2.5 mi) farther along the shore to the NE from Khan Minyeh, and almost that same distance SW of the point where the Jordan River enters the Sea of Galilee. The coastal plain here is quite narrow, but in ancient times a road led from the Jordan down past Capernaum and through the Plain of Gennesaret to connect with the great trade route leading from Mesopotamia and Damascus, through Palestine and on to Egypt. A number of springs flow across the Plain of Gennesaret, emptying into the blue waters of the Sea of Galilee, and the large amount of vegetable matter these springs carry draws large numbers of fish, making the area an excellent location for fishermen.​—PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 739.</p>",

The home of the fishermen Peter and Andrew was in Capernaum, and here Jesus healed Peter’s mother-in-law; after this, the house was besieged by people bringing ill and demon-possessed persons to him for healing.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mr 1:29-34;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/12/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Lu 4:38-41</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Following a preaching tour of Galilee, accompanied by the four disciples called from the Capernaum vicinity, Jesus returned to Capernaum, which by now could be called “his own city,” the place where he could be said to be “at home.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 9:1;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/13/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Mr 2:1</a>) Again the crowds flocked around the house, and on this occasion Jesus healed a paralytic who was lowered through an opening in the roof.

                "<p class=\"sb\">After going into Judea and Jerusalem and attending the Passover of 31 C.E., Jesus returned to Galilee, and it seems likely that it was on a mountain in the neighborhood of Capernaum that he chose the 12 to be his apostles and delivered the renowned Sermon on the Mount. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 6:12-49</a>) Entering Capernaum, he was met by Jewish elders acting as intermediaries on behalf of an army officer who had demonstrated love for the Jewish nation, even building a synagogue in the city for them. This Gentile officer’s unquestioning faith in Jesus’ power to heal a sick slave even from a distance (as he had earlier healed the child of the king’s attendant) caused Jesus to marvel and resulted in Jesus’ prophecy that persons “from eastern parts and western parts” would recline at the table along with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of the heavens.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 8:5-13;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/17/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Lu 7:1-10</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Toward the close of his second preaching tour in Galilee and after activity in the country of the Gerasenes (or Gadarenes) SE of the Sea of Galilee, Jesus “crossed back again . . . to the opposite shore,” likely to the vicinity of Capernaum.

Again, though Jesus gave orders against telling others of this resurrection, “the talk about this spread out into all that region.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 9:18-26;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/19/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Mr 5:22-43;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/19/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Lu 8:40-56</a>) Possibly in Capernaum or its vicinity Jesus also healed two blind men as well as a speechless man possessed of a demon.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 9:27-34</a>.</p>",

After entering Capernaum, he was located by crowds who had followed him from across the sea. When Jesus gave a discourse designed to correct the basically materialistic interest in him that had been shown by the majority, many of his disciples defected from the ranks of his followers. This left a smaller number of faithful ones.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Finally, it was in Capernaum, sometime prior to the Festival of Booths in the year 32 C.E., when his major activity in Galilee and the northern part of the country was nearing its conclusion, that Jesus miraculously provided money for the temple tax and presented illustrations concerning greatness <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>in the Kingdom of the heavens, strayed sheep, and the settling of difficulties.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/24/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 17:24–18:35;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/24/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Mr 9:33-50;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/24/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Lu 9:46-50</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Capernaum was included by Jesus with the nearby cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida as one of the places in which most of his powerful works had been performed. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/25/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 11:20-24;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000882/25/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Lu 10:13-15</a>) Capernaum had been exalted heaven high in a spiritual way by the presence, preaching, and miracles of Jesus, but it would now be abased, as it were, to Hades, here representing the depth of its abasement. Using hyperbole, Jesus said that even Sodom would not have perished if it had been as highly favored as was Capernaum. Today Capernaum, like Sodom, no longer exists as a city, its ruins at Tell Hum (Kefar Nahum) stretching out for about 1.5 km (1 mi) along the seacoast.</p>"

During the Persian period, from the sixth century B.C.E., the city spread westward to include the peninsula that forms the N end of the Bay of Haifa. The port of the city was located there from the Persian period onward. By the time of the Christian Era, the location of Acco had come to include the peninsula and is included in the area of modern ʽAkko.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Situated about 39 km (24 mi) S of Tyre, Acco was the most important seaport on the harbor-shy Palestinian coast until Herod the Great ran seawalls out from the shore to produce an artificial port at Caesarea. Acco was inferior to the Phoenician <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>ports to the N and provided but poor shelter from the sea winds. However, it was strategically located close to the approach to the rich Plain of Jezreel (Esdraelon), and several commercial trade routes connected the port with Galilee, the Jordan Valley, and other points to the east.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Acco pertained to the territorial division assigned to Asher in the Promised Land, but Asher failed to drive out the Canaanites who were then living there.

However, lexicographers consider the form Kanna to be a very unlikely transition from Cana, particularly because of the doubling of the “n.” There is reason to believe that Kafr Kanna’s claim to being Cana stems largely from its being easily accessible to pilgrims from Nazareth, causing it to have the favor of church tradition.</p>",

Reeds are abundant in a nearby marshy plain, making the name Cana very fitting. It is still known in Arabic as Qana el-Jelil, equivalent of Cana of Galilee. Josephus, the Jewish historian of the first century C.E., speaks of residing “at a village of Galilee called Cana” and later makes mention of “the great plain, called the plain of Asochis, in which my quarters lay.” (<em>The Life,</em> 86 [16]; 207 [41]) This testimony would also favor the location of Cana of Galilee at the site of Khirbet Qana, rather than Kafr Kanna. Although no spring is found at Khirbet Qana, the ruins reveal the remains of ancient cisterns; potsherds (fragments of earthen vessels), and coins believed to date from the first century C.E. have also reportedly been found there.​—PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 738.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\">In all the dealings the Tyrians had with Israel, there is no indication that, as a people, they were interested in the worship of Jehovah; their association was particularly a commercial one. Racially they were Canaanites, and religiously they practiced a form of Baal worship, their chief deities being Melkart and Astarte (Ashtoreth). When Ethbaal was king of the Sidonians (including Tyre), his daughter Jezebel married Ahab, the king of the northern kingdom of Israel. Jezebel was infamous in her determination to blot out the worship of Jehovah.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 16:29,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 31;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 18:4,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 13,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 19</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Condemned by God.</strong> It was not, however, for the personal wickedness of Jezebel and her daughter Athaliah that Tyre came under heavy divine condemnation. Tyre grew to be very great at the expense of other peoples, including Israel. She was a manufacturer of metal objects, <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>glassware, and purple dyes and was a trading center for the overland caravans as well as a great import-export depot. Along with this industrial and commercial growth came riches, conceit, and pride. Her merchants and tradesmen boasted of being princes and honorable ones of the earth. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 23:8</a>) Tyre in time also developed an attitude of opposition to Jehovah and conspired with neighboring nations against God’s people.

                "<p class=\"sb\">In the latter part of the ninth century B.C.E., Jehovah took note of this city’s arrogant attitude. He therefore warned her that she would be paid back in kind for robbing his people of the gold, silver, and many other desirable things that she had used to beautify her temples. There was also to be an accounting for Tyre’s having sold God’s people into slavery.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joe 3:4-8;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/12/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Am 1:9, 10</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Later the prophet Isaiah recorded a further pronouncement against Tyre, which indicated that she would be forgotten for “seventy years.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 23:1-18</a>) Years thereafter the prophet Jeremiah included Tyre among those nations that were singled out to drink the wine of Jehovah’s rage.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Also through Ezekiel, a contemporary of Jeremiah, Jehovah pointed to calamity for Tyre at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 26:1–28:19</a>) Though Tyre had been compared to a pretty ship with multicolored sails and deck coverings and a prow inlaid with ivory, she would sink in the open sea. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 27:3-36</a>) Tyre’s ‘king’ (apparently the line of Tyrian rulers) haughtily boasted: “I am a god.

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Destruction of City.</strong> In the course of Nebuchadnezzar’s long siege against Tyre, the heads of his soldiers were “made bald” from the chafing of their helmets, and their shoulders were “rubbed bare” from carrying materials used in the construction of siegeworks. Since Nebuchadnezzar received no “wages” for serving as His instrument in executing judgment upon Tyre, Jehovah promised to compensate him with the wealth of Egypt. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 29:17-20</a>) According to the Jewish historian Josephus, the siege lasted 13 years (<em>Against Apion,</em> I, 156 [21]), and it cost the Babylonians a great deal. Secular history does not record exactly how thorough or effective Nebuchadnezzar’s efforts were. But the loss in lives and property to the Tyrians must have been great.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 26:7-12</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">When the Israelites returned from Babylonian exile, however, the Tyrians were able to assist in supplying cedar timbers from Lebanon for a second temple, and they resumed their trade with the rebuilt city of Jerusalem.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/21/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ezr 3:7;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/21/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Ne 13:16</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Tyre’s conflict with Nebuchadnezzar, though great, was not to be the complete end for Tyre. A later prophetic pronouncement indicated that, though Tyre would build a rampart and pile up silver and gold, Jehovah himself would destroy her completely.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/22/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zec 9:3, 4</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Nearly 200 years after Zechariah’s prophecy was given, it was fulfilled. In 332 B.C.E. Alexander the Great marched his army across Asia Minor and, in his sweep southward, paused long enough to give his attention to Tyre. When the city refused to open its gates, Alexander in his rage had his army scrape up the ruins of the mainland city and throw it into the sea, thus building a causeway out to the island city, all of this in fulfillment of prophecy. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/23/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 26:4,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/23/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12</a>; DIAGRAM, Vol 2, p. 531) With his naval forces holding the Tyrian ships bottled up in their harbor, Alexander set about constructing the highest siege towers ever used in ancient wars. Finally, after seven months the 46-m-high (150 ft) walls were breached. In addition to the 8,000 military men killed in battle, 2,000 prominent leaders were killed as a reprisal, and 30,000 inhabitants were sold into slavery.</p>",

The Scriptural references point to a place on the N shores of the Sea of Galilee. The name is connected by Josephus with a populous village lying a short distance to the E of the point where the Jordan River enters the Sea of Galilee. This village was rebuilt by Philip the tetrarch and was named Julias in honor of the daughter of Caesar Augustus. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XVIII, 28 [ii, 1]) The ancient ruins of the site of Julias itself are at et-Tell, about 3 km (2 mi) from the sea; however, remains of a smaller fishing settlement are located at el-ʽAraj right on the shore. Here a natural harbor was used by fishermen up until recent times, so the place geographically fits the meaning of the name Bethsaida.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">While accepting this identification as applying to Bethsaida in some of the texts, a number of commentators contend for a second Bethsaida somewhere to the W of the Jordan. This view is due to the understanding, based on statements by Josephus and others, that the territorial limitation of Galilee did not extend E of the Jordan. Josephus <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>himself speaks of Julias as in “lower Gaulanitis,” the region to the E of the Sea of Galilee. (<em>The Jewish War,</em> II, 168 [ix, 1]) Yet Bethsaida is said to be “of Galilee.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000708/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 12:21</a>) However, the region of Galilee does not seem to have always been so precisely defined, Josephus even referring to one Judas of Gaulanitis as “a Galilaean.” (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XVIII, 4 [i, 1]; <em>The Jewish War,</em> II, 118 [viii, 1]) It is also quite possible that the city of Bethsaida had some of its population extending as far as the W bank of the Jordan, about 1.5 km (1 mi) distant.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Additionally, since the <em>King James Version</em> rendering of <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000708/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mark 6:45</a> states that Jesus instructed his apostles “to go [by boat] to the other side before unto Bethsaida,” while the parallel passage at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000708/11/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">John 6:17</a> gives their destination as Capernaum, some have held that this likewise requires a second Bethsaida on the W side of the Jordan near Capernaum. Modern translations of the text at <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000708/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mark 6:45</a>, however, allow for the understanding that the apostles began their trip toward Capernaum by first going coastwise “toward Bethsaida” (the point from which they left Jesus evidently being near the site of the miraculous feeding of the 5,000, likely some distance S of Bethsaida and on the opposite side of the sea from Capernaum), and thereafter crossing over the northern end of the sea, heading for the ultimate destination, Capernaum. They landed on the shores of the land of Gennesaret, apparently somewhat S of the city of Capernaum.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000708/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mr 6:53</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Thus, while various locations have been suggested for a second Bethsaida, the Biblical accounts do not require this. It may also be noted that these suggested sites are all near Capernaum and it would be quite unlikely for two cities bearing the name of Bethsaida to be situated only a few miles apart.</p>"

                "<p class=\"sb\">A league or confederation of ten cities (from Greek <em>deʹka,</em> meaning “ten,” and <em>poʹlis,</em> “city”). The name also applied to the region in which most of these cities were centered.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 4:25</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Following the conquest by Alexander the Great in about 332 B.C.E., Greek colonies developed in Syria and Palestine, apparently settled by veterans from Alexander’s armies who were thereafter followed by Greek-speaking immigrants. In many cases these colonies grew on the sites of earlier Jewish towns, while in others they were built on fresh sites, particularly E of the Jordan River. They flourished during the rule of the Seleucids of Syria and the Ptolemies of Egypt, but the rise of the Maccabean-Jewish state (starting c. 168 B.C.E.) greatly jeopardized their relatively independent position. While the populations of these cities doubtless included many Jews, still these cities were centers of Greek culture and organization and hence were very much out of step with the Maccabean aims. When Pompey conquered and reorganized Palestine in 63 B.C.E., these Hellenistic cities were given Roman protection and a favored status. They were allowed to mint their own coins and, to a great extent, to exercise self-government, although they still owed allegiance to Rome and to the Syrian provincial government and were required to pay taxes and provide men for military service.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Formation of the League.</strong> Likely sometime between Pompey’s conquest and the death of Herod the Great (c. 1 B.C.E.) ten of these Hellenistic cities formed themselves into the loose federation known as the Decapolis. The motive underlying this union seems to have been a mutual interest in close trade relations and also defense against either anti-Hellenistic forces within Palestine or aggressive nomadic tribes in the desert regions to the E. The term “Decapolis” first appears in the Christian Greek Scriptures and in the writings of Josephus and Pliny the Elder (both of the first century C.E.). Pliny, while acknowledging that some difference of opinion already existed, listed the following cities as among the original ten: Damascus, Philadelphia, Raphana, Scythopolis, Gadara, Hippo (Hippos), Dion, Pella, Galasa <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>(Gerasa), and Canatha. (<em>Natural History,</em> V, XVI, 74) Of these, only Scythopolis (Beth-shean) lay W of the Jordan; because of the strategic position of the Valley of Esdraelon (Jezreel), it served as an important link with the Mediterranean Coast and seaports. Damascus, far to the N in Syria, was evidently included because of its importance as a trade center. Philadelphia (ancient Rabbah, modern ʽAmman) was the southernmost of the ten cities, only about 40 km (25 mi) NE of the northern end of the Dead Sea. The remainder of the cities were in the fertile region of Gilead or neighboring Bashan. Most of them are believed to have been on or near the main roads of that region. Canatha is likely the Kenath of <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Numbers 32:42</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In the second century C.E., Ptolemy names 18 cities as in the “Decapolis,” which may indicate that the name came to be used in a general way and that the number of cities varied. Some scholars would put Abila, listed by Ptolemy, in place of Raphana as among the original ten. It seems evident, at any rate, that the Decapolis region did not have precisely defined boundaries and that the authority of the cities of the Decapolis did not embrace all the intervening territory but applied only within the district of each particular city.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Jesus’ Ministry and the Decapolis.</strong> While people from the Decapolis were among the crowds that flocked to hear Jesus’ teaching in Galilee (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 4:25</a>), there is no specific mention of his having devoted time to any of its Hellenistic cities. Jesus did enter the region of Decapolis during his Galilean ministry when he crossed the Sea of Galilee and entered the country of the Gerasenes (or Gadarenes according to <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 8:28</a>).

                "<p class=\"sb\">After the Passover of 32 C.E., and upon returning from a trip to the regions of Tyre and Sidon in Phoenicia, Jesus came “to the sea of Galilee up through the midst of the regions of Decapolis.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mr 7:31</a>) Somewhere in this region he healed a deaf man having a speech impediment and later miraculously fed a crowd of 4,000.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mr 7:32–8:9</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Later History.</strong> According to Eusebius, prior to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E., Christians of Judea fled to the Decapolitan city of Pella in the mountainous region of Gilead, thereby giving heed to Jesus’ prophetic warning.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001141/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 21:20, 21</a>; <em>The Ecclesiastical History,</em> III, V, 3.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">By no means alone among the cities of Palestine in their Hellenistic leanings, the cities of the Decapolis reflected the most powerful expression of Greek influence. They are believed to have reached their peak during the second century C.E., and in the following century the league began to break up. Evidence of the strong Greek influence, as well as the wealth of the Decapolitan cities, can be seen in the impressive remains of theaters, amphitheaters, temples, baths, aqueducts, and other structures at Gerasa (modern Jarash) as well as at other cities.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>1.</strong> The Carmel Range is a wedge-shaped spur of the central mountain range of Israel, running out therefrom in a NW direction with its NW headland coming to about 180 m (600 ft) from the Mediterranean Sea. The entire range measures some 50 km (30 mi) in length, stretching from the Mediterranean down to the Plain of Dothan, beyond which lie the hills of Samaria. The range has three distinct sections, the ridges of the NW and SE being separated by a lower rocky basin or plateau in the center. The NW section, which is located NW of ʽIsfiya, has the highest point, some 545 m (1,790 ft) above sea level. It is not certain whether the name Carmel in Bible times applied to the entire range or only to the NW ridge, which is about 21 km (13 mi) long. In modern times the name Mount Carmel (Jebel el-Karmal; Har Karmel) is assigned to this latter part. Jokneam, a royal Canaanite city, lay at the SE end of this upper section, and it is spoken of as being “in Carmel.” Megiddo and Taanach, on the E slopes of the SE section, are not so designated.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000892/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 12:22</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">The land into which Israel moved when they crossed the Jordan may be divided geographically into three basic sections, each running the length of the land from N to S: the Jordan Valley, the hill country, and the coastal plain. The Carmel Range, however, makes a definite break in this general pattern. Interrupting the continuity of the N-S mountain ranges, it produces the well-known Valley of Jezreel, or Esdraelon, which flanks the SE side of the Carmel Range. Similarly, the headland or promontory of Carmel, jutting into the Mediterranean coastal plain, divides it into the Plain of Asher (N of Carmel) and the plains of Sharon and of Philistia (S of Carmel). Immediately N of the Carmel headland, the coastline cuts back sharply to form the Bay of Acco, where modern Haifa now constitutes a major seaport. Carmel formed one of the boundary markers in the territory of the tribe of Asher.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000892/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jos 19:24-26</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Carmel formed a natural roadblock to caravans and armies traveling between Mesopotamia and Egypt. The eastern slopes (facing the Plain of Asher and the Valley of Jezreel) rise very steeply, and from ancient times the Carmel Range has been covered by a thick growth of trees and shrubs, which make passage difficult. There is a narrow strip of land between the foot of the Carmel headland and the sea, but to take this route meant a considerable detour and also placed advancing armies in a vulnerable position. There were mountain passes leading from the Valley of Jezreel across the range by the fortress cities of Jokneam and Taanach, but the pass at Megiddo, between these two, was much easier to traverse and so was more vital. Another principal route, however, ran S from the crossroads town of Megiddo, skirted the remainder of the Carmel Range, and then swung W over to the coast via the Plain of Dothan.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Carmel is often associated with fertile regions such as Lebanon, Sharon, and Bashan.

The majestic appearance of Carmel, particularly the headland that sweeps dramatically upward from the coast, even as Mount Tabor rises impressively in the Valley of Jezreel, was also used to represent the imposing figure of Nebuchadnezzar advancing to the conquest of Egypt.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000892/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jer 46:18</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Carmel was evidently one of the principal places to which people of Samaria fled when seeking refuge. Though by no means the highest of the ranges, its sparse population, its dense forest cover, and also the numerous caves in the soft limestone of its rocky slopes served to hide the refugees.

According to what is considered to be the best available manuscript evidence, Matthew originally used “country of the Gadarenes,” whereas Mark and Luke, in relating this event, employed “country of the Gerasenes.”​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 8:28;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/0/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Mr 5:1;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/0/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Lu 8:26</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Both countries are shown to lie on “the other side,” that is, the E side, of the Sea of Galilee. The designation “country of the Gadarenes” possibly applied to the district radiating from the city of Gadara (modern Umm Qeis), situated about 10 km (6 mi) SE of the Sea of Galilee. Coins of Gadara often depict a ship, suggesting that its territory may have extended as far as the Sea of Galilee and therefore could have included at least a part of “the country of the Gerasenes,” to the E of that body of water. Others link “the country of the Gerasenes” with the region around Kursi, the town that Origen and Eusebius identified as Gergesa. It is on the E coast of the Sea of Galilee, about 20 km (12 mi) N of Gadara. It best fits the geographical details of the account. Others link it with the large district centered at the city of Gerasa (Jarash) about 55 km (34 mi) SSE of the Sea of Galilee and suggest that it extended to the E of that lake and embraced “the country of the Gadarenes.” In any case, Matthew’s account would in no way conflict with that of Mark and Luke.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Near an unnamed city in the country of the Gadarenes, Jesus Christ met two unusually fierce demon-possessed men. These had their dwelling among the tombs, that is, rock-cut tombs or natural caves used as such. Jesus, in expelling the demons, permitted them to take possession of a large herd of swine that subsequently rushed over a precipice and drowned in the Sea of Galilee. This so disturbed the local inhabitants that they entreated Jesus to depart from the area.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/1/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 8:28-34</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">While Matthew mentions two men, <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/2/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mark (5:2</a>) and <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/3/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Luke (8:27</a>) center attention on only one, doubtless because his case was more outstanding. Possibly he was more violent and had suffered much longer under demon control than the other man; yet afterward perhaps he alone wanted to accompany the Son of God. Jesus did not allow him to do so, directing him instead to make known what God had done in his behalf.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">This differed from Jesus’ usual instructions not to have his miracles advertised. Instead of seeking showy publicity and having people reach conclusions on the basis of sensational reports, Jesus apparently wanted others to decide on solid evidence that he was indeed the Christ. This also fulfilled the prophetic words spoken through Isaiah: “He will not wrangle, nor cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the broad ways.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 12:15-21;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/4/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Isa 42:1-4</a>) However, the exception in the case of the former demoniac was appropriate. He could bear witness among people with whom the Son of God would have only limited contact, particularly in view of Jesus’ being requested to leave. The man’s presence would provide testimony about Jesus’ power to work good, counteracting any unfavorable report that might be circulated over the loss of the herd of swine.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mr 5:1-20;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/5/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Lu 8:26-39</a>; see <a href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001584/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SWINE</a>.</p>"

                "<p class=\"sb\">Tyre in time became one of the great sea powers of the ancient world, and her mariners and commercial fleet of “Tarshish” ships were famous for their voyages to faraway places. Solomon and the king of Tyre cooperated in a joint shipping venture for the importing of precious things including gold from Ophir.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 9:26-28;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/8/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 10:11,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/8/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 22;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/8/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2Ch 9:21</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">In all the dealings the Tyrians had with Israel, there is no indication that, as a people, they were interested in the worship of Jehovah; their association was particularly a commercial one. Racially they were Canaanites, and religiously they practiced a form of Baal worship, their chief deities being Melkart and Astarte (Ashtoreth). When Ethbaal was king of the Sidonians (including Tyre), his daughter Jezebel married Ahab, the king of the northern kingdom of Israel. Jezebel was infamous in her determination to blot out the worship of Jehovah.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 16:29,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 31;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 18:4,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 13,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 19</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Condemned by God.</strong> It was not, however, for the personal wickedness of Jezebel and her daughter Athaliah that Tyre came under heavy divine condemnation. Tyre grew to be very great at the expense of other peoples, including Israel. She was a manufacturer of metal objects, <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>glassware, and purple dyes and was a trading center for the overland caravans as well as a great import-export depot. Along with this industrial and commercial growth came riches, conceit, and pride. Her merchants and tradesmen boasted of being princes and honorable ones of the earth. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 23:8</a>) Tyre in time also developed an attitude of opposition to Jehovah and conspired with neighboring nations against God’s people.

                "<p class=\"sb\">In the latter part of the ninth century B.C.E., Jehovah took note of this city’s arrogant attitude. He therefore warned her that she would be paid back in kind for robbing his people of the gold, silver, and many other desirable things that she had used to beautify her temples. There was also to be an accounting for Tyre’s having sold God’s people into slavery.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joe 3:4-8;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/12/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Am 1:9, 10</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Later the prophet Isaiah recorded a further pronouncement against Tyre, which indicated that she would be forgotten for “seventy years.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 23:1-18</a>) Years thereafter the prophet Jeremiah included Tyre among those nations that were singled out to drink the wine of Jehovah’s rage.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Also through Ezekiel, a contemporary of Jeremiah, Jehovah pointed to calamity for Tyre at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 26:1–28:19</a>) Though Tyre had been compared to a pretty ship with multicolored sails and deck coverings and a prow inlaid with ivory, she would sink in the open sea. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 27:3-36</a>) Tyre’s ‘king’ (apparently the line of Tyrian rulers) haughtily boasted: “I am a god.

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Destruction of City.</strong> In the course of Nebuchadnezzar’s long siege against Tyre, the heads of his soldiers were “made bald” from the chafing of their helmets, and their shoulders were “rubbed bare” from carrying materials used in the construction of siegeworks. Since Nebuchadnezzar received no “wages” for serving as His instrument in executing judgment upon Tyre, Jehovah promised to compensate him with the wealth of Egypt. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 29:17-20</a>) According to the Jewish historian Josephus, the siege lasted 13 years (<em>Against Apion,</em> I, 156 [21]), and it cost the Babylonians a great deal. Secular history does not record exactly how thorough or effective Nebuchadnezzar’s efforts were. But the loss in lives and property to the Tyrians must have been great.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 26:7-12</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">When the Israelites returned from Babylonian exile, however, the Tyrians were able to assist in supplying cedar timbers from Lebanon for a second temple, and they resumed their trade with the rebuilt city of Jerusalem.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/21/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ezr 3:7;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/21/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Ne 13:16</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Tyre’s conflict with Nebuchadnezzar, though great, was not to be the complete end for Tyre. A later prophetic pronouncement indicated that, though Tyre would build a rampart and pile up silver and gold, Jehovah himself would destroy her completely.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/22/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zec 9:3, 4</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Nearly 200 years after Zechariah’s prophecy was given, it was fulfilled. In 332 B.C.E. Alexander the Great marched his army across Asia Minor and, in his sweep southward, paused long enough to give his attention to Tyre. When the city refused to open its gates, Alexander in his rage had his army scrape up the ruins of the mainland city and throw it into the sea, thus building a causeway out to the island city, all of this in fulfillment of prophecy. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/23/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 26:4,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/23/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12</a>; DIAGRAM, Vol 2, p. 531) With his naval forces holding the Tyrian ships bottled up in their harbor, Alexander set about constructing the highest siege towers ever used in ancient wars. Finally, after seven months the 46-m-high (150 ft) walls were breached. In addition to the 8,000 military men killed in battle, 2,000 prominent leaders were killed as a reprisal, and 30,000 inhabitants were sold into slavery.</p>",

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Boundaries.</strong> (MAP, Vol. 2, p. 738) Over the years, the territorial boundaries of Galilee did not remain constant. Their greatest extent seems to have been about 100 by 50 km (60 by 30 mi) and embraced the ancient territories of the tribes of Asher, Issachar, Naphtali, and Zebulun. However, during the time of Jesus Christ’s earthly ministry, Galilee, while under the jurisdiction of Herod Antipas (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/4/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 3:1</a>), extended only about 40 km (25 mi) from E to W and about 60 km (37 mi) from N to S.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">To the S lay Samaria, Galilee’s southern boundary extending from the foot of Mount Carmel along the Valley of Jezreel (Esdraelon) toward Scythopolis (Beth-shean) and then to the Jordan. According to Josephus, the Jordan River, with the Sea of Galilee and Lake Hula (now mostly drained), constituted the eastern boundary, but there may have been areas where that boundary was not so precise. The territory of Tyre, reaching below the ancient city of Kedesh (Kedasa, Cydasa), bounded Galilee on the N. (<em>The Jewish War,</em> III, 35-40 [iii, 1]; II, 459 [xviii, 1]; IV, 104, 105 [ii, 3]) To the W lay the territory of Ptolemais (Acco) and Mount Carmel.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">This northerly Roman province of Palestine W of the Jordan was further divided into Upper and Lower Galilee. The boundary between the two Galilees extended from Tiberias on the W bank of the Sea of Galilee to a point in the vicinity of Ptolemais.​—<em>The Jewish War,</em> III, 35 (iii, 1).</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Geographic Characteristics.</strong> In the first century C.E., before the war with Rome, Galilee was densely populated and enjoyed great prosperity. A thriving fishing industry existed at the Sea of Galilee. Other occupations included weaving, stonecutting, shipbuilding, and pottery manufacture. The Jewish historian Josephus claimed there were 204 cities and villages in Galilee, the smallest of these numbering over 15,000 inhabitants. If this testimony is not an exaggeration, as many believe it to be, this would mean that Galilee had a population of about three million.​—<em>The Life,</em> 235 (45); <em>The Jewish War,</em> III, 43 (iii, 2).</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Galilee was blessed with abundant springs and fertile soil. So the chief occupation of the Galileans apparently was agriculture. Today many different kinds of vegetables, as well as wheat, barley, figs, millet, indigo, olives, rice, sugarcane, oranges, pears, and apricots, are cultivated. Anciently, Galilee was heavily wooded. Among the varieties of trees still found there are cedar, cypress, fir, oak, oleander, palm, pine, sycamore, and walnut.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Both the climate and the geographic features of Galilee are marked by great contrast. The highlands are cool, the seacoast enjoys a mild temperature, and the Jordan Valley is hot. The altitude of Lower Galilee plunges to about 210 m (689 ft) below sea level in the vicinity of the Sea of Galilee and reaches its highest point at Mount Tabor, with an elevation of 562 m (1,844 ft). (PICTURE, Vol. 1, p. 334) However, the hills and mountains of Upper Galilee range from 460 m (1,500 ft) to 1,208 m (3,963 ft) in height.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>People of Galilee.</strong> As a group, the Jews of Galilee differed from those of Judea. According to the testimony of rabbis of ancient times, the <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>Galileans valued reputation, whereas the Judeans placed greater emphasis on money than on a good name. The Galileans generally were not such sticklers for tradition as were the Judeans. In the Talmud (<em>Megillah</em> 75<em>a</em>), the former are, in fact, charged with neglecting tradition. In this regard it may be noted that Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem, not from Galilee, were the ones who took issue with the failure of Jesus’ disciples to observe the traditional washing of hands.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/5/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mr 7:1,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/5/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 5</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Since the Sanhedrin and the temple were in Jerusalem, doubtless a greater concentration of teachers of the Law was to be found there; hence the Jewish proverb: “Go north [to Galilee] for riches, go south [to Judea] for wisdom.” But this does not mean that the Galileans were steeped in ignorance. Throughout the cities and villages of Galilee there were teachers of the Law as well as synagogues. The latter were, in effect, educational centers. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/6/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 5:17</a>) However, the chief priests and Pharisees at Jerusalem evidently considered themselves superior to the common Galileans and viewed them as ignorant of the Law. For example, when Nicodemus spoke up in defense of Jesus Christ, the Pharisees retorted: “You are not also out of Galilee, are you? Search and see that no prophet is to be raised up out of Galilee.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/7/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 7:45-52</a>) Thus they ignored the fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy concerning Messiah’s preaching.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/8/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 9:1, 2;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/8/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Mt 4:13-17</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Some ascribe the distinct Galilean accent to foreign influence. It is not at all unusual that the Galileans were easily recognized by their speech (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 26:73</a>), especially since the region of Samaria separated Galilee from Judea. Even today, in many parts of the earth, people are readily identified by their regional accent. Also, among the tribes of Israel pronunciation differences existed centuries previously. A striking example of this is the inability of the Ephraimites in Jephthah’s day to pronounce the password “Shibboleth” correctly.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/10/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jg 12:5, 6</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong><em>Jesus’ ministry in Galilee.</em></strong> Galilee was the scene for many outstanding events in Jesus’ earthly life. The Galilean cities of Bethsaida, Cana, Capernaum, Chorazin, Nain, and Nazareth, as well as the regions of Magadan, are specifically mentioned in connection with his activity.

In the course of time he came to his hometown, Nazareth, where, on the Sabbath day, he read his commission from <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/15/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isaiah chapter 61</a>. Although those in the synagogue were at first favorably impressed, when Jesus compared them to the Israelites in the days of the prophets Elijah and Elisha, the synagogue audience became enraged, and they were ready to kill him.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 4:14-30</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Afterward Jesus went to Capernaum, “a city of Galilee,” and established this as his home. Evidently near Capernaum he called Andrew, Peter, James, and John to be fishers of men. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/17/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 4:31;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/17/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Mt 4:13-22</a>) Accompanied by these four disciples, Jesus began a major preaching tour of Galilee. In the course of his activities of teaching and performing powerful works, Jesus called Matthew from the tax office at Capernaum to be his follower. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/18/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 4:23-25;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/18/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 9:1-9</a>) Later, at a mountain near Capernaum, he chose the 12 apostles. All of them, with the possible exception of Judas Iscariot, were Galileans. Also near Capernaum, Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 6:12-49;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/19/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 7:1</a>) At the Galilean city of Nain, he resurrected the only son of a widow. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 7:11-17</a>) In a later preaching tour, Jesus revisited Nazareth but was again rejected. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/21/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mt 13:54-58</a>) At Capernaum, around Passover time of 32 C.E., during what was apparently his final intensive coverage of Galilean territory, many disciples, stumbled by Jesus’ words about ‘eating his flesh and drinking his blood,’ forsook the Son of God.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/22/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 6:22-71</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Although the synoptic Gospels tell mainly of Jesus’ ministry in Galilee, the Son of God did not ignore Judea, as some have wrongly concluded. It is noteworthy that the initial interest the Galileans showed in Jesus was aroused by what they saw him do in Jerusalem. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/23/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joh 4:45</a>) However, probably more space is devoted to Jesus’ activity in Galilee because the Galileans responded more readily than did the Judeans. This is confirmed by the fact that the first disciples to receive God’s holy spirit were Galileans, some 120 in number. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/24/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ac 1:15;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/24/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2:1-7</a>) The control and influence of the Jewish religious leaders must not have been as strong among the Galileans as among the Judeans. (Compare <a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/25/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lu 11:52;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/25/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Joh 7:47-52;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001598/25/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12:42, 43</a>.)

Since Dan is located at the base of the Anti-Lebanon mountains (and not far from Mount Hermon), this may mean that Moses’ view reached up to that range. The use of the name Dan here could correspond to its usage in the case of Abraham or could be the result of Joshua’s recording the final portion of the book, which includes events following Moses’ death.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Dan lay in “the low plain that belonged to Beth-rehob,” and this area, N of the waters of Merom and just below Lebanon, was a fertile and very desirable region, well watered.

The city was on a high mound near the southern foot of Mount Hermon and overlooked the spacious Hula Basin.

These names evidently derive from the circumstance that Mount Hermon is snowcapped nearly the year around. Its snowy top might be said to resemble an old man’s crown of white hair. In ancient times, this mountain was known to the Sidonians as “Sirion” and to the Amorites as “Senir.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001999/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 3:8, 9</a>) The latter name also seems to have been used to denote a part of the Anti-Lebanon Range.

These names evidently derive from the circumstance that Mount Hermon is snowcapped nearly the year around. Its snowy top might be said to resemble an old man’s crown of white hair. In ancient times, this mountain was known to the Sidonians as “Sirion” and to the Amorites as “Senir.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001999/0/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">De 3:8, 9</a>) The latter name also seems to have been used to denote a part of the Anti-Lebanon Range.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Forming the S end of the Anti-Lebanon Range, Mount Hermon rises 2,814 m (9,232 ft) above sea level and extends about 30 km (19 mi) from N to S. Its several peaks are connected by a plateau.

Its upper portion is completely bare with the exception of low shrubs in places. But lower down, there are firs, fruit trees, and shrubs. Vineyards occupy the lower slopes of the western and southern sides.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">On a clear day, the top of Hermon affords a splendid view of much of Palestine. To the W can be seen the mountains of Lebanon, the Plain of Tyre, and the Mediterranean Sea; to the SW, Mount Carmel; to the S, the Jordan Valley with the Hula Basin and the Sea of Galilee; and to the E, the Plain of Damascus.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Mount Hermon’s snowy head serves to condense the night vapors, thus producing abundant dew. “More copious dew,” observed the 19th-century naturalist H. B. Tristram, “we never experienced. Everything was drenched with it, and the tents were small protection.” (<em>The Land of Israel,</em> London, 1866, pp. 608, 609) The refreshing dew of Hermon preserves vegetation during the long rainless season.

Reporting on the excavations at Hazor, Yigael Yadin, in his work <em>The Art of Warfare in Biblical Lands</em> (1963, Vol. II, p. 288), writes: “As the first sign of the gate of this wall began to emerge from the dust and earth that were gently being scooped away, we were struck by its similarity to the ‘Gate of Solomon’ which had been discovered at Megiddo. Before proceeding further with the excavation, we made tentative markings of the ground following our estimate of the plan of the <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>gate on the basis of the Megiddo gate. And then we told the laborers to go ahead and continue removing the debris. When they had finished, they looked at us with astonishment, as if we were magicians or fortune-tellers.

It is first mentioned after the conquest of the Promised Land in about 1467 B.C.E., and at that time it was a fortified city. This mention of Tyre was in connection with the boundaries of Asher’s tribal territory.

                "<p class=\"sb\">In all the dealings the Tyrians had with Israel, there is no indication that, as a people, they were interested in the worship of Jehovah; their association was particularly a commercial one. Racially they were Canaanites, and religiously they practiced a form of Baal worship, their chief deities being Melkart and Astarte (Ashtoreth). When Ethbaal was king of the Sidonians (including Tyre), his daughter Jezebel married Ahab, the king of the northern kingdom of Israel. Jezebel was infamous in her determination to blot out the worship of Jehovah.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1Ki 16:29,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 31;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 18:4,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 13,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/9/4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 19</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Condemned by God.</strong> It was not, however, for the personal wickedness of Jezebel and her daughter Athaliah that Tyre came under heavy divine condemnation. Tyre grew to be very great at the expense of other peoples, including Israel. She was a manufacturer of metal objects, <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"pageNum\"></span>glassware, and purple dyes and was a trading center for the overland caravans as well as a great import-export depot. Along with this industrial and commercial growth came riches, conceit, and pride. Her merchants and tradesmen boasted of being princes and honorable ones of the earth.

                "<p class=\"sb\">In the latter part of the ninth century B.C.E., Jehovah took note of this city’s arrogant attitude. He therefore warned her that she would be paid back in kind for robbing his people of the gold, silver, and many other desirable things that she had used to beautify her temples. There was also to be an accounting for Tyre’s having sold God’s people into slavery.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/12/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joe 3:4-8;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/12/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Am 1:9, 10</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Later the prophet Isaiah recorded a further pronouncement against Tyre, which indicated that she would be forgotten for “seventy years.” (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/13/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Isa 23:1-18</a>) Years thereafter the prophet Jeremiah included Tyre among those nations that were singled out to drink the wine of Jehovah’s rage.

                "<p class=\"sb\">Also through Ezekiel, a contemporary of Jeremiah, Jehovah pointed to calamity for Tyre at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/16/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 26:1–28:19</a>) Though Tyre had been compared to a pretty ship with multicolored sails and deck coverings and a prow inlaid with ivory, she would sink in the open sea.

                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Destruction of City.</strong> In the course of Nebuchadnezzar’s long siege against Tyre, the heads of his soldiers were “made bald” from the chafing of their helmets, and their shoulders were “rubbed bare” from carrying materials used in the construction of siegeworks. Since Nebuchadnezzar received no “wages” for serving as His instrument in executing judgment upon Tyre, Jehovah promised to compensate him with the wealth of Egypt. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/19/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 29:17-20</a>) According to the Jewish historian Josephus, the siege lasted 13 years (<em>Against Apion,</em> I, 156 [21]), and it cost the Babylonians a great deal. Secular history does not record exactly how thorough or effective Nebuchadnezzar’s efforts were. But the loss in lives and property to the Tyrians must have been great.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/20/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 26:7-12</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">When the Israelites returned from Babylonian exile, however, the Tyrians were able to assist in supplying cedar timbers from Lebanon for a second temple, and they resumed their trade with the rebuilt city of Jerusalem.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/21/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ezr 3:7;</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/21/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Ne 13:16</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Tyre’s conflict with Nebuchadnezzar, though great, was not to be the complete end for Tyre. A later prophetic pronouncement indicated that, though Tyre would build a rampart and pile up silver and gold, Jehovah himself would destroy her completely.​—<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/22/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zec 9:3, 4</a>.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\">Nearly 200 years after Zechariah’s prophecy was given, it was fulfilled. In 332 B.C.E. Alexander the Great marched his army across Asia Minor and, in his sweep southward, paused long enough to give his attention to Tyre. When the city refused to open its gates, Alexander in his rage had his army scrape up the ruins of the mainland city and throw it into the sea, thus building a causeway out to the island city, all of this in fulfillment of prophecy. (<a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/23/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eze 26:4,</a><a class=\"b\" href=\"https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004498/23/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 12</a>; DIAGRAM, Vol 2, p. 531) With his naval forces holding the Tyrian ships bottled up in their harbor, Alexander set about constructing the highest siege towers ever used in ancient wars. Finally, after seven months the 46-m-high (150 ft) walls were breached. In addition to the 8,000 military men killed in battle, 2,000 prominent leaders were killed as a reprisal, and 30,000 inhabitants were sold into slavery.</p>",
                "<p class=\"sb\"><strong>Mentioned in the Greek Scriptures.</strong> Despite the city’s total destruction by Alexander, it was rebuilt during the Seleucid period, and in the first century C.E. it was a prominent port of call on the Mediterranean.

Caesar Augustus gave Paneas to Herod the Great, who thereafter built a white marble temple in the place, dedicating it to Augustus. Herod’s son, Philip the tetrarch, later enlarged and beautified the city in honor of Tiberius Caesar. It was then given the name Caesarea and, to distinguish it from the seaport city of the same name, was called Caesarea Philippi. Still later the city was again enlarged and adorned by Herod Agrippa II, and its name was changed to Neronias, though this name quickly passed into disuse following the death of Nero. Josephus relates that, after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E., General Titus staged gladiatorial events there, using captive Jews as victims. (<em>The Jewish War,</em> VII, 23, 24 [ii, 1]) In course of time the name of the city reverted to its ancient name of Paneas, and in Arabic (which uses no “p”) this became Banyas.</p>",
